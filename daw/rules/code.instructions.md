# Phase 3: CODE (Implementation)

**Goal:** implement the solution per the approved spec/fix-plan.

Read `.daw-state.json.tier` to determine your behavior.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE — Gates run through the Skill tool

The CODE gates (`daw-validate-arch`, `daw-test`, `daw-security-sast`) run **EXCLUSIVELY by invoking
the Skill tool** with `skill="<name>"`. **Running them by hand with Bash is FORBIDDEN.**

- ❌ NEVER run the test runner directly (`npx jest`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`, `gradle test`,
  `xcodebuild test`, etc.). That skips what `daw-test` encapsulates: scope detection, generating
  missing tests, the auto-fix loop (max 3 attempts), and updating `gates.tests` in the state.
- ❌ NEVER run linters/architecture analysis by hand instead of `daw-validate-arch`.
- ❌ NEVER run SAST tools by hand instead of `daw-security-sast`.
- ✅ ALWAYS `Skill(skill="daw-test")`, `Skill(skill="daw-validate-arch")`,
  `Skill(skill="daw-security-sast")`.

Having Bash available is NOT authorization to reimplement a gate manually. If the skill uses Bash
internally, that is the skill's business — the main agent invokes the skill, not the runner.

**Single exception:** the project's type checker / linter (closeout step #2) IS run with Bash
directly, because no skill encapsulates it. Everything else goes through the Skill tool.

**What is enforced, said plainly.** No hook can tell a test run inside the skill's protocol from
one outside it, and a measured run acknowledged this rule and then ran the runner directly six
times — so pretending the sentence above is a gate would be the gap that reads as coverage. What
the FSM actually holds is downstream and cannot be talked past: `gates.tests` opens only on the
validated run report's receipt (`validate_tests.py`), and the block marker only on the reviews.
A direct runner invocation earns nothing and its numbers are not the record — the run that counts
is the one the report describes. The rule stands as the protocol's discipline; the receipt is its
enforcement.

---

## Self-check before running tests (MANDATORY in every block and closeout)

**Before ANY Bash command that runs tests** (`jest`, `npx jest`, `npm test`, `npm run test*`,
`pytest`, `go test`, `gradle test`, `xcodebuild test`, etc.), STOP and verify internally:

1. Am I in the CODE phase? → Yes: tests go through `Skill(skill="daw-test")`, not through Bash.
2. Have I already invoked `Skill(skill="daw-test")` for THIS specific block/closeout?
   - **NO** → STOP. Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-test")` first. The skill handles execution (detects
     scope, generates missing tests, auto-fix loop, updates `gates.tests`).
   - **YES** → is the command I am about to run part of the protocol the skill loaded, or a shortcut
     of my own? If it is a shortcut → STOP.

**If it fails → STOP:** `⚠️ Test self-check failed: I was about to run [command] without invoking
Skill(test) in this block.`

### Known ANTI-PATTERN (do NOT repeat it)

The most common failure mode: invoking `Skill(skill="daw-test")` in Block 1, then in Blocks 2..N
running `npx jest` / `npm test` directly "because I already did it before". **FORBIDDEN.** Every
block and every closeout (including the re-closeout after a fix) ALWAYS starts by invoking
`Skill(skill="daw-test")`. There is no "already ran it, skipping". The reflex "tests = jest" is NOT
authorization.

---

## Session Recovery

If this is a new session (the agent just started and `phase` was already `CODE`):
1. Read the spec/fix-plan from `docs/daw/specs/` (derived from the ticket).
2. Read `block` from the state to know which block we are on (e.g. `"2/5"`).
3. Report the current state to the user before continuing.

---

## Mandatory FIRST Action

**Before writing the first line of code:**
1. Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-validate-arch")` over the current codebase.
2. If it reports violations:
   - Show the report to the user.
   - **BLOCKED** until the existing violations are resolved, or documented as accepted technical
     debt.
3. If it passes → continue with the implementation.

---

## If tier == FEATURE

### Block-by-block implementation — a subagent per block + two-stage review

**Each block is implemented by a fresh subagent, and you — the orchestrator — review it when it
comes back.** Do not implement the block yourself in the main context.

The reason is twofold. First, **isolation**: the implementer starts clean, with the spec and its
block, dragging in neither the earlier conversation nor the noise of previous blocks — which ties it
to the written contract instead of to what was said in passing. Second, **honest review**: whoever
reviews is not whoever wrote, which is the only way a review is worth anything.

For each block of the spec (starting from the one indicated in the state's `block`, or 1 at the
start):

1. **Announce:** "Implementing Block N of M: [name]".

2. **Dispatch the implementer.** Spawn via the Agent tool with `subagent_type="daw-implementer"`,
   passing it: the spec, **which block is theirs** (number, name and description), and the
   conventions from `AGENTS.md`. One subagent **per block** — not one for all of them.

3. **Receive its report** and read it. It carries the status, the files touched, the tests, **the
   assumptions it made** and findings outside its scope. If it returned `BLOCKED`, do not push:
   resolve whatever stopped it (this may require a corrective loop back to PLAN) and dispatch again.

4. **Two-stage review** of what it returned. In this order, because they are different questions:
   - **(a) Does it meet the spec?** → `Agent(subagent_type="daw-module-verifier")` scoped to this
     block. Verifies that what got built is what the block asked for, no more and no less — **and
     that the TDD evidence is there**: the report must show the tests failing before implementation,
     with the assertions that broke. Missing or empty evidence = the block FAILS, however good the
     code looks. A test that never failed proves nothing.
   - **(b) Is it well built?** → `Agent(subagent_type="daw-arch-auditor")` over the files it
     touched. Verifies conventions and architecture against `AGENTS.md`.

   **An auditor's report is only a report with its closing line** — `HALLAZGOS: <N> — lista
   completa`, with `<N>` matching what it lists. A report without the line, or whose count does
   not match, is a report cut mid-write (measured live: thirteen findings, five delivered, and
   the user decided over five): relaunch the agent; never accept it, and never fill the gap
   yourself.

   If (a) fails → dispatch the implementer again with the correction. If (b) fails → same, with the
   violations pointed out. Maximum **3 rounds** per block; if it still fails on the third, stop and
   raise it with the user: the problem is probably in the spec, not in the code.

   **Land both verdicts on disk**: write `.daw-work/review-block-N.md` with a `verifier:` line
   (the module-verifier's verdict — spec compliance and the TDD evidence) and an `arch:` line
   (the arch-auditor's — conventions against `AGENTS.md`). Step 8's marker update refuses to
   advance without this file, because a measured run watched the auditor die mid-audit and the
   orchestrator review its own block "quickly, myself" — and the record kept no trace that the
   independent review had collapsed into self-judgement. If a review agent died, dispatch it
   again: your own reading of your own block is not one of the two verdicts, and writing it into
   the file as if it were is a false record, not a workaround.

5. **Mechanical gates for the block:** `Skill(skill="daw-test")` for the block's tests. **ALWAYS, in
   EVERY block** — do not assume that because you invoked it in the previous one you can run
   `jest`/`npm test` directly. See the self-check before running tests.
   - If it fails → go back to the implementer (max 3 attempts).
   - **Do NOT move to the next block while the tests fail.**

6. **Record the assumptions — on disk, not only in the conversation.** If the implementer
   declared assumptions, **show them to the user** before moving to the next block: an unreviewed
   assumption is a decision nobody made. And once reviewed, **append each one to
   `docs/daw/specs/decisions-{ticket}.md`** (`decision — who approved it — date — which block`),
   committed with the block. Not to the spec: while the `spec` gate stands, the spec is sealed
   against every write — the seal is what stops a pipeline editing an approved design — so a rule
   saying "add it to the spec" would be ordering a write the guard refuses. An approved assumption
   that lives only in the chat is a decision the record denies: measured on a live run, no
   document ever learned the rate limit was 60/min or why bcrypt was pinned — the user approved
   both, and a reader of the artifacts finds thresholds nobody chose. (A decision big enough to
   change the design is not an assumption — that is the corrective loop to PLAN, and it costs the
   re-approval.)

   And if implementing the block forced a decision the spec did not already make — a different data
   structure, a renamed module, one valid approach chosen over another — write it as an ADR through
   the `daw-create-adr` skill (`docs/adr/adr-NNN-title.md`) before committing, so the commit carries
   the decision and its reasons together. PLAN asks the same question about its own design; this is
   the half that only shows up once the code is being written.

7. **Commit the block** with `Skill(skill="daw-commit")`: its code and its tests, in one commit, with
   the tier's gitmoji. **One block = one commit** — the same rule
   `.daw/rules/commits.instructions.md` states for every other unit of work.

   The block has just passed the two reviews and its tests; that is a state worth keeping. Leaving
   three blocks uncommitted so they can share one commit at the end means a session that stops after
   the second one loses both — which is the exact loss the per-phase commit exists to prevent, one
   level down. **The commit goes before the state update**, so an interruption between the two leaves
   work committed and a block to redo, never a block marked done with nothing on disk.

   The `commit` gate stays untouched here: only the closeout edge's commit sets it (see the note in
   `.daw/rules/commits.instructions.md`).

8. **Update the block marker through the helper** — `python3 .daw/scripts/transition.py --block N/M --write`
   (e.g. `--block 3/5`, or `--block none` if it was the last). This is an in-phase update: no
   history entry, no phase change, and the journal records the new value. The flag exists because
   this step used to say "update the state" with no sanctioned way to do it — the paths left were
   a hand Edit the reconstruction guard fails closed on, or the shell the method forbids, and a
   live run took each once.

   `--block N/M` means **block N is FINISHED** — reviews included. The helper and the hook both
   refuse the update while `.daw-work/review-block-N.md` (step 4) is missing its two verdicts.
   Do not set the marker on entering the phase: it is written after a block finishes, never
   before one starts. (A live run set `1/5` on arrival, which reads as "block 1 done" with no
   block implemented.)

9. **Report progress:** "Block N completed (N/M)."

> 🔎 **Why the implementer neither commits nor touches the state.** Its job is to write code inside a
> bounded scope and give an account of it. **The commit belongs to the orchestrator** — which commits
> once per block, at step 7, after the reviews it ran itself came back green — **and so does the
> state**. The invariant is who commits, not how often: if a subagent could move either, the state
> machine would break from the inside.

### When the spec is the thing that is wrong

Implementation is what finds the errors a spec could not: a block that names the wrong file, a
contract that contradicts the PRD, a test assigned to the block that cannot run it. **This is not a
question.** A failed validation never asks permission to be corrected — the corrective loop is
mandatory everywhere else in this method — and neither does this. What the loop is NOT allowed to be
is silent, and what it is NOT allowed to skip is the approval at the other end.

**The spec is not writable from CODE.** The write gate refuses it while the `spec` gate stands, and
the refusal is the point: a document that changes shape under a gate nobody re-earned is the one
thing the pipeline promises cannot happen. There is no version of this you fix in place.

So, on finding it:

1. **Stop the block.** Not at the end of the phase, not "noted for VERIFY" — there is no such place,
   and a deviation promised to a phase that has nowhere to put it is a deviation lost. Round 6
   measured exactly that: CODE found a real spec error, announced it would be recorded in VERIFY,
   and it never was.
2. **Say it out loud, with the flag up — and on disk.** Name the discrepancy, what the spec says,
   what the code needs, and that you are going back to PLAN because of it. Write that reason to
   `.daw-work/goback-proposal.txt` as `correction: <the discrepancy> — CODE -> PLAN`: the hook
   reads it before letting the edge through under `assisted`, and it is the move's durable record.
   (If what you found is a DECISION rather than a defect — two valid designs, an answer nobody
   wrote — that is the `ask:` lane, and the edge waits for the user's turn:
   `state.instructions.md` § Going back.) This is the signpost — the user is about to approve a
   spec for the second time, and an approval that does not know it is a re-approval is a rubber
   stamp.
3. **Take `CODE → PLAN`.** It is in the graph and it `clears` the `spec` and `threat` gates. Update
   the state through the helper like any other transition. **`block` stays where it is** — you are
   coming back to the same block, not restarting the phase.
4. **In PLAN: correct, re-validate, re-approve.** The spec's `Loops since last human decision`
   counter goes up like any other corrective loop, `F-SPEC-LOOP` caps it at 3, and the banner that
   asks for the approval says what brought you back:
   `🙋 TU TURNO — ¿Aprobás la spec corregida? (volvimos de CODE · Block 2: <la discrepancia>)`.
5. **Return to CODE** by the ordinary edge, re-earning `spec` and `threat`, and resume the block you
   left.

> **What does NOT come back here.** A block whose CODE is wrong against a spec that is right is a
> correction inside CODE — dispatch the implementer again (step 4). The trip to PLAN is for when the
> document is wrong, and the test of which one it is: after the change, does the spec say something
> different from what it said before? If yes, it is PLAN's.

### Session Rule
The user can say "stop here" or close the session between blocks. Progress is recorded in the
state's `block`. On resume, work continues from the last incomplete block.

---

## If tier == FIX

### Direct Implementation

1. Read the fix-plan from `docs/daw/specs/fix-{ticket}.md`.
2. Implement all the fix-plan's steps in sequence.
3. Write the specified tests. The **regression test comes first**: it must reproduce the bug and
   fail BEFORE the fix, then pass after it. That is the evidence the fix addresses the real cause.
4. **Verify the rollback plan:** confirm the fix-plan's rollback steps are still valid after the
   implementation.
5. Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-validate-arch")`.
   - If it fails → fix and re-run (max 3 attempts).
6. Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-test")`.
   - If it fails → fix and re-run (max 3 attempts).

> **Stability over elegance.** A FIX resolves a defect; it is not the moment to refactor.

---

## Closeout Sequence (MANDATORY, every tier that reaches CODE)

> **Where it goes next depends on the tier.** QUICK-FIX has no VERIFY phase: it
> transitions straight to **CLOSEOUT** (`CODE → CLOSEOUT`, gates `define`, `tests`,
> `sast`). FIX and FEATURE go to **VERIFY** (`CODE → VERIFY`, gates `tests`,
> `sast`). The graph is the authority; taking the other edge is a refused write,
> not a detour.

Once the WHOLE implementation is complete (all blocks or all steps):

### 1. Full test suite
Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-test")` (the whole suite, not just the new tests).
- If it FAILS → fix. Do not advance. Max 3 attempts.
- If it PASSES → **write the run report** to `docs/daw/reports/tests-{ticket}.md` and validate it:
  `python3 .daw/scripts/validate_tests.py docs/daw/reports/tests-{ticket}.md --tier <tier>`.
  The rules are `F-TEST-01` to `F-TEST-08` and `W-TEST-01` in
  `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §6: the runner and the exact command, counts that
  add up, every failure named, three coverage numbers against a floor quoted from the project, every
  skip explained, one run per report, and zero failures. A PASSED run writes the receipt the `tests`
  gate demands.
- `gates.tests` = `true` only with that receipt on disk. DAW does not run your suite and the receipt
  does not say it did — it says the report of the run you did is complete enough to be read and
  re-run by someone else.
- **Re-closeout after a fix:** if you corrected something and need to revalidate the suite,
  **invoke `Skill(skill="daw-test")` again** — do NOT run `npm run test:all`/`npx jest` directly.
  The re-closeout is NOT an exception to the rule.

### 2. Type checker / Lint
Run the project's type checker and linter (if they are configured in `AGENTS.md`, "Stack" section).
- If it FAILS → fix. Max 3 attempts.
- If it PASSES → record the result in the test report (`W-TEST-01` asks for it there, and F-VER-05
  will ask for it again in VERIFY) and continue to SAST.

Report format:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Type checker / Lint — [PASSED | BLOCKED]                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│  [Errors found, with file:line — description]            │
│                                                          │
│  Total: [N] errors                                       │
│  Next: [fix N errors | continue to SAST]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. SAST — Static Security Analysis
Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-security-sast")`.

**BLOCKING GATE.** If it finds vulnerabilities:
- Show the report to the user.
- Spawn an agent via the Agent tool with `subagent_type="daw-sec-auditor"` for triage (true positive
  vs false positive). Do NOT read AGENT.md as a file. Its report must end with the closing line
  (`HALLAZGOS: <N> — lista completa`, count matching) — without it, relaunch: a cut report and a
  finished one look identical, and that is exactly the trap.
- Fix the vulnerabilities confirmed as true positives.
- Re-invoke `Skill(skill="daw-security-sast")`. Max 3 attempts.
- Only when it PASSES: add `"sast": true` to `gates`.

If it finds no vulnerabilities:
- `gates.sast` = `true`.

### 4. The decisions record

**Before the edge out of CODE, `docs/daw/specs/decisions-{ticket}.md` must exist** — the FSM
refuses `CODE → VERIFY` (and QUICK-FIX's `CODE → CLOSEOUT`) without it. Step 6 has been appending
to it block by block; if this ticket genuinely decided nothing outside its approved documents, the
file says exactly that:

```
No decisions were approved outside the spec during this ticket.
```

That sentence is not bureaucracy: it turns "nobody wrote the decisions down" and "there were no
decisions" into different states on disk. Measured on a general run, a ticket closed CODE carrying
a stack decision, two accepted risks and an approved split — every one approved in a picker, none
anywhere a reader of the artifacts could find. Commit the file with the closeout.

### 5. Transition

Only if `gates.tests` AND `gates.sast` are `true`:

Present the summary to the user:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

After the user approves:
1. **Commit whatever the closeout produced** with `Skill(skill="daw-commit")`: the fixes the full
   suite, the linter or SAST demanded, with the tier's gitmoji.
   - **FEATURE:** each block was already committed at step 7 of its loop. This commit covers only
     what the closeout itself changed.
   - **FIX / QUICK-FIX:** there are no blocks, so this is the implementation's commit — code +
     tests, committed here because here is where it is green.
   - **If the working tree is clean**, commit nothing. The record is already on the branch; an empty
     commit to mark the phase is noise.
2. Update the state:
   - `phase` → `"VERIFY"`
   - Add an entry to `history`: transition CODE → VERIFY, **stamped with `ticket` and `tier`** (see `.daw/rules/state.instructions.md`)

---

## Active Conventions

Follow these strictly during implementation:
- The project's architecture conventions ("Architecture conventions" section of `AGENTS.md`) for
  structure and patterns.
- `.daw/rules/testing.instructions.md` for tests.
- `.daw/rules/security.instructions.md` for secure coding practices.

---

**FORBIDDEN in this phase:**
- Modifying the spec/fix-plan
- Modifying the PRD
- Committing a block before its two reviews and its tests came back green. **The implementer
  subagent never commits at all** — the orchestrator does, one commit per block, plus whatever the
  closeout changed
- Creating PRs
- Skipping the closeout sequence (tests + SAST)
