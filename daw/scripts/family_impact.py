"""DAW — the impact analysis's deterministic half.

Standing in ANY repo of a family, classification's first duty is the impact
question: which members does this work hit, and which does it provably not.
The MODEL owns the verdict; this script owns everything a script can own —
so the verdict is written over fresh, complete, recorded facts instead of
memory and goodwill:

  gather (default)   Resolve the family from this repo's `## Repo family`,
                     then READ every member at its default branch — the map
                     (daw-family.md) and each member's seams — straight from
                     the forge, no clone: looking at a repository is not a
                     reason to put it on disk, and at family-of-a-thousand
                     scale it is not affordable either. A sibling clone is
                     the offline fallback, never the first choice, and
                     nothing is ever cloned. Each member records the SHA it
                     was read at AND how it was read, so the receipt can say
                     which repos came from the forge and which from a disk
                     that may be behind. The facts land in
                     `.daw-work/impact-data-<ticket>.json`.

  --validate FILE    Judge the model-written verdict at FILE against the
                     gathered facts: EVERY member must appear — impacted, or
                     under "Sin impacto" with a non-empty reason — and no
                     invented repo may appear as impacted. On PASS, write the
                     content-hashed receipt the CLASSIFY→DEFINE gate demands.

The receipt's honest bargain (daw_receipt.py says it plainly): it does not
prove the judgment is right — it proves the judgment was made over the whole
family, freshly read, and that skipping the step is a deliberate act that
leaves no file where the record demands one.

Usage:
  python3 family_impact.py [--root .] [--ticket T-1] [--siblings DIR]
  python3 family_impact.py --validate .daw-work/impact-T-1.md [--root .]
