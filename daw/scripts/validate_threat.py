"""daw-threat-modeling, the mechanical half — run by the skill, never re-derived.

The threat model was the most self-declared artifact in the pipeline: seven FAIL
rules, two warnings, a box the model drew itself, and a `threat` gate that turned
true because the model said the analysis went well. F-TM-06 exists precisely
because a threat model can be a template with nothing of the real system in it —
and nothing was checking F-TM-06 either.

What a parser can answer here is narrower than for the PRD, and the split is the
point rather than an apology: **whether every component got all six STRIDE
categories, whether the boundaries and the classification exist, whether every
risk carries a mitigation, whether an accepted risk carries its three fields, and
whether the document names the real design** are structural questions. Whether
the analysis is *correct* is not, and no receipt will make it so. The report says
which is which, on every run.

Rules mirror `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §3 — the catalog is
the source of truth; this file implements, it does not redefine.

Exit: 0 = PASSED (warnings allowed) · 2 = FAILED · 3 = cannot read/parse.
