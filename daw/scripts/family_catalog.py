"""The family catalog, derived — never written by hand.

Every serious service catalog converges on the same two lessons, and this file
is DAW's application of both. First: **the descriptor lives in the repo it
describes; the center only aggregates.** Each repo declares its own
`## Repo family` section in its own `AGENTS.md`; this script reads those
declarations and regenerates the workspace's consolidated view. Second:
**hand-maintained catalogs rot** — day-one enthusiasm, then drift, then "kind
of accurate, in places", then nobody trusts it. A catalog that is derived on
demand from files that travel with the code cannot drift further than one
re-run.

Membership is self-declared: a repo belongs to this workspace's catalog if and
only if its `AGENTS.md` declares `Workspace = <this workspace's slug>`. Joining
is adding the section; leaving is removing it — and a removal is ANNOTATED in
the block on the next run, never silent, the same rule `done (unverified:)`
follows: the count may degrade out loud, with a reason, and no other way.

The output is a managed block in `docs/daw/family-catalog.md`, delimited by
`<!-- BEGIN DAW CATALOG -->` / `<!-- END DAW CATALOG -->` — the `.gitignore`
block's pattern: outside the markers the file is the user's; inside, no hand
writes. Each row records the blob sha of the `AGENTS.md` it was derived from,
so `--check` is a comparison, not an opinion: shas moved → the catalog is
stale, exit 3, nothing written.

A repo whose `AGENTS.md` cannot be fetched is marked `(unreachable: …)` and
KEPT — the `_family_child_merged` lesson: "gh fell over" and "no section" must
never read the same, because one is retried and the other is the finding.

Credentials: none stored, ever. Every remote read is the user's own `gh`, the
same authority the pr gate already leans on.

`--write-members` is the owner's decision, taken out loud (2026-08-26): the
family's map is AUTHORED once, centrally, in the workspace's `daw-family.md`, and
this routine PROPAGATES it — creating or updating each member clone's
`## Repo family` section and committing in that clone under the user's own
git identity. This is the user administering their own repositories with
their own credentials, the installer's class of act, not a pipeline session
writing across repos (which stays forbidden). Only the section between the
`## Repo family` heading and the next `##` is touched; the rest of each
AGENTS.md is its repo's own. Pushes are listed, not taken — `--push` takes
them, for terminals where the user's SSH agent is live.

    python3 family_catalog.py                  # derive, write the block, report
    python3 family_catalog.py --check          # is it fresh? exit 0/3, write nothing
    python3 family_catalog.py --write-members --local DIR
        # the other direction: propagate the map in daw-family.md into each
        # member clone's AGENTS.md `## Repo family` section, and commit there

        # a seed daw-family.md as a one-approve PR per family with no map;
        # an existing map is never rewritten — its drift is reported.

    python3 family_catalog.py --sweep --org ACME [--facts-out FILE]

        # every repo's tree read from its TARBALL (never a clone), and the
        # facts a row of prose may lean on recorded with THE PATH each one
        # came from and the SHA the repo was read at. No model runs here and
        # no prose is written: this is what the prose is later held to.

    python3 family_catalog.py --admit STORE_DIR [--facts FILE]
        # the ADMISSION gate over the prose half: renglones.md and fichas/
        # judged against the sweep's facts. Coverage (every swept repo has a
        # row), no invention (no row names a repo nobody read), and every
        # claim citing a file the sweep FOUND, at the SHA it was read. It does
        # not check that a claim is true — a file that exists is not a claim
        # that holds — and the run says so out loud.

    python3 family_catalog.py --stale STORE_DIR [--org ACME]
        # the REFRESH question, and the reason this is affordable at a
        # thousand repos: not "did this repo move" (almost always yes, and
        # worthless) but "did it move where a row LEANS". Adds/deletes, a
        # cited file, or a structural path make a row stale; anything else
        # leaves it true. It names which rows to re-sweep, and why each one.

Exit: 0 = fresh / regenerated / swept / admitted / nothing stale · 2 = cannot

# it has to pass to enter the store, and it checks exactly three things — the
# three a script CAN check:
#
#   1. COVERAGE — every repo the sweep read has a row. A store that quietly
#      omits repos answers "who do I hit?" over a smaller organisation, in
#      green, which is the failure mode the whole method is built against.
#   2. NO INVENTION — no row names a repo the sweep never saw.
#   3. CITATIONS RESOLVE — every claim in a ficha names a file, and that file
#      is one the sweep actually found in that repo at that SHA.
#
# What it does NOT check, said plainly because the receipt says it too: that a
# claim is TRUE. A file that exists is not a claim that holds. What the gate
# buys is that every claim points at something real in a real commit, that the
# whole organisation is accounted for, and that a ficha written against an
# older commit cannot pass as current. The truth of the sentence stays a human
# reading, and the store says which commit to read it against.

# because their SHA changed is the same cost as never having indexed anything.
#
# The SHA answers "did this repo move", which is almost always yes and is
# therefore worthless on its own. The question that matters is "did it move
# somewhere this row DEPENDS on", and the citations make it answerable: a row
# is stale when the diff since it was read touches a file that row cites, adds
# or deletes any file, or lands on a structural path. A commit inside a
# function nobody cited leaves the row true, and the row is left alone.
#
# The three filters are not a proof, and the report says which one fired. What
# closes the remaining gap is the full re-sweep, run cold, and the fact that
# every row carries the commit it was read at — so "this row is behind" is
# always answerable, even when the filters missed.
