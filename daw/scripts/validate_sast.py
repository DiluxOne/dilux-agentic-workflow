"""daw-security-sast, the mechanical half — run by the skill, never re-derived.

**What this attests, and what it cannot.** It does not scan your code and it does
not know whether the findings are right. It reads the report the skill wrote and
answers structural questions: did every category the catalog names get a verdict,
does every finding carry a file and a line, does the stated result follow from the
severities listed, does every suppression carry its fields and a review date that
has not expired. The judgement stays the model's; what stops being optional is the
*shape* of the record it leaves — and a report that cannot be parsed is a report
nobody can check, which is how nineteen rules came to be catalogued and none of
them executed.

That distinction is why this exists at all. `docs/RATIONALE.md` decision 16
refused a receipt for `sast` on the grounds that it would dress "the model
reported it looked" up as proof. It would — of the code. It does not, of the
report: exactly the split `validate_verify.py` already makes for the verification
verdict, where the numbers remain the model's and the completeness does not.

Rules mirror `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §4 — the catalog is
the source of truth; this file implements, it does not redefine.

Exit: 0 = PASSED (warnings allowed) · 2 = FAILED · 3 = cannot read/parse.
