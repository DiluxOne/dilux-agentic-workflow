"""daw-create-adr's mechanical half — the only artifact that had no checker.

Every other document in DAW has a validator pinning what it is: a PRD that is
not a PRD fails eight checks before anyone reads it. The ADR had none, so the
one thing that makes it an ADR — that it EXPLAINS a decision already taken and
binds nobody — rested entirely on the model having the genre right. A different
model, or the same one in a hurry, writes "the system must rate-limit to 5 per
IP" and now a document no gate reads and no script judges is issuing
requirements, competing with the spec for authority over the implementation.

That is the rule this exists for (F-ADR-03), and it is checkable: normative verbs
in the Decision and Consequences sections. The other four are shape.

**No gate reads this.** An ADR is written only when a decision warrants one, so a
gate would demand one per ticket and fill `docs/adr/` with filler, which is worse
than the gap it closes. This is run by the skill that writes the ADR, and its
verdict is for the person reading it.

Rules mirror `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §7 — the catalog is
the source of truth; this file implements, it does not redefine.

Exit: 0 = PASSED (warnings allowed) · 2 = FAILED · 3 = cannot read/parse.
