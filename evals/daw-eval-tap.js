// DAW — verdict tap for the OpenCode adapter.
//
// Installed by the eval runner only, AROUND the adapter's own plugin. It
// changes no verdict — it records one, in the same
// `.daw-eval-verdicts.jsonl` the Claude Code tap writes, with the same fields
// (`hook`, `exit`, `tool`, `path`), so `judge_repo_state` does not change.
//
// Why a wrapper and not a shell shim: OpenCode's adapter is a JavaScript
// plugin, not a hook script. Its enforcement boundary is the pair of hooks
// `tool.execute.before` / `tool.execute.after`, and its verdict is not an exit
// code but a THROW: the plugin runs the shared gate with execFileSync and
// re-throws as `DAW blocked the write.` Throwing is what stops the tool call.
// So the tap wraps the returned hook table and reads that boundary directly:
//
//     the real hook returned  -> exit 0   (allowed)
//     the real hook threw     -> exit 2   (blocked; same code Claude's hooks use)
//
// This is the honest reading. It records what the enforcement layer actually
// did to the tool call, not what the model said about it, and it records
// NOTHING when the plugin never loads or never runs — which leaves the
// scenario red, as it must.
