# Phase 2: PLAN (Technical Planning)

**Goal:** design the technical solution and write it to disk as a spec or fix-plan.

**Do NOT use Claude's Plan Mode (EnterPlanMode) in this phase.** Design here is conversational:
read, analyze, present to the user, iterate, and write the spec/fix-plan to disk once they approve.

Read `.ddw-state.json.tier` to determine your behavior.

---

## Rules for this Phase

- "go ahead", "approved", "go", "run it" or any variant of approval means **WRITE THE SPEC/FIX-PLAN
  DOCUMENT TO DISK**. It does not mean writing source code.
- After writing to disk: run `ddw-validate-spec`, present the summary, and **STOP**. Do not write
  code.
- If the user says "run the code" or "implement it": answer "We are in the PLAN phase. First I write
  the spec to disk, then we move to CODE to implement. Shall I save the spec?"
- **NEVER modify the PRD in this phase.** If the design reveals the PRD needs changes, apply the
  corrective loop protocol (see the section below).

---

## Corrective loop back to DEFINE (when the PRD needs changes)

**Trigger:** during technical design you discover the PRD needs modification. This can happen
because:
- A technical decision changes a requirement (e.g. dropping a field, changing an entity).
- The design reveals an FR is incomplete or contradictory.
- The user asks for a change during the conversation that impacts the requirements.

**Protocol:**

1. **Announce it, and put the motivating question FIRST.** A corrective loop is mandatory
   everywhere else in this method (`validation-rules.instructions.md` §2: "the loop is
   mandatory"), so permission to correct a known defect is never what gets asked — that is a
   rubber stamp. What IS asked is the decision that motivates the loop (the box below, plus the
   question under it), and under `assisted` it is asked BEFORE the edge is taken
   (`state.instructions.md` § Going back) — **and the hook holds the edge to it**: write the
   question to `.ddw-work/goback-proposal.txt` as `ask: <the question> — PLAN -> DEFINE`, show
   it, end your turn, and the edge passes only once the user's turn sealed that exact text.
   Measured on a live run: the loop was taken first and the user was asked which stack should
   prevail after — into a phase already re-entered and a gate already spent, when their answer
   could have been "neither, drop the ticket". Same shape as CODE's return to PLAN
   (`code.instructions.md`).

   ```

   │  The `define` gate comes off and is earned again — your  │
   │  approval of the corrected PRD is what pays for it.      │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

   **What is still the user's, and is asked — before step 2 takes the loop:** WHAT the
   requirement becomes. A loop back does not authorise inventing the new wording — that is a
   decision nobody wrote down, and it stops the run in either autonomy mode.

2. **Taking the loop:**
   - Update `.ddw-state.json`:
     - `phase` → `"DEFINE"`
     - Remove `define` from `gates` (it will be re-validated)
     - Add an entry to `history`: corrective loop PLAN → DEFINE (reason in `action`), **stamped with `ticket` and `tier`** (see `.ddw/rules/state.instructions.md`)
   - **Do not delete the PLAN artifacts** (if there is a partial spec on disk, leave it — it will be
     picked up on return).

3. **In DEFINE (re-entry):**
   - Apply the modifications to the PRD.
   - **The banner that asks for the approval says what brought it back** — an approval that does
     not know it is a re-approval is a rubber stamp: `🙋 TU TURNO — ¿Aprobás el PRD corregido?
     Volvimos de PLAN: [la razón]. Cambió: [qué dice ahora que antes no decía]`.
   - Increment `PRD loops` in the header, and reset `Loops since last human decision` to 0: coming
     back from PLAN is a decision a person made, which is exactly what the ceiling waits for.
   - Run `ddw-validate-prd` (MANDATORY — no exceptions).
   - The user approves the updated PRD.
   - Transition back to PLAN: `phase` → `"PLAN"`, `gates.define` → `true`.

4. **On returning to PLAN:**
   - Resume designing the spec, taking the PRD changes into account.
   - If there was a partial spec on disk, update it to reflect the changes.
   - Continue the normal PLAN flow.

---

## OpenSpec opt-in (all PLAN tiers)

Only an `AGENTS.md` containing `Spec format: OpenSpec` under the exact heading
`## Specification framework` enables this integration. In that mode, PLAN:

- reads `openspec/specs/` as the product baseline;
- creates or updates exactly one proposed change at `openspec/changes/<slug>/`,
  including its proposal, design, tasks, and capability deltas;
- keeps the DAW spec/fix-plan as the ticket's execution plan, with numbered
  implementation work and PRD coverage, and links the change in its header;
- requires both DAW validation and `openspec validate <slug> --strict` before
  the existing `spec` gate can be earned. **F-OS-01** enforces that the DAW
  plan links exactly one change, strict validation passes, and the receipt is
  bound to hashes of every regular file in that change; naming a change without
  the explicit opt-in fails that rule.

The spec receipt includes the linked change's current files. Editing either the
DAW plan or any file in that change invalidates the receipt, so return to PLAN
and validate both again. Do not modify `openspec/specs/` to pre-approve a
proposal or treat a proposed delta as current product behavior. Without this
exact opt-in, the PLAN flow and its artifacts are unchanged.

---

## If tier == FEATURE

### Inputs
- The PRD at `docs/ddw/prd/prd-{ticket}.md` (if `gates.define` is true)
- The project's stack: the "Stack" section of `AGENTS.md`
- The project's architecture conventions ("Architecture conventions" section of `AGENTS.md`)

### Design Process
1. Read the complete PRD.
2. Read the architecture conventions.
3. Design the technical solution:
   - Components affected
   - Schema/API changes
   - New files to create
   - Existing files to modify
   - New dependencies
4. Split it into numbered implementation blocks. Each block must be independently verifiable.
   **Then ask what step 3 decided that a reader six months from now could not reconstruct**, and
   write an ADR for each one through the `ddw-create-adr` skill (`docs/adr/adr-NNN-title.md`,
   outside `docs/ddw/`, because the decision belongs to the project and not to the tool that helped
   record it). Its own triggers are: choosing between two or more valid technical approaches,
   changing a data structure or a schema, and renaming entities, tables or modules. Choosing an
   in-process rate limit over a CAPTCHA is one; picking a library over another is one; "we used
   FastAPI because AGENTS.md says so" is not.

   The skill validates what it writes with `validate_adr.py`, applying **every rule in section 7 of
   `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md`** (`F-ADR-01` to `F-ADR-05`, `W-ADR-01` to
   `W-ADR-02`). No gate reads that verdict — an ADR is written only when a decision warrants one,
   and a gate would demand one per ticket — so closing its loop is part of this step.

   This is asked here, in the phase, because it used to be asked only inside the skill — which the
   model reads only after deciding to invoke it, so the condition for writing an ADR lived behind
   the decision it was meant to trigger. Measured on a real run: the design chose a rate limit over
   a CAPTCHA, explained the trade-off well, and wrote no ADR. Nobody had told it to look.
5. **Impact check against the codebase (MANDATORY before presenting).**
6. Present the plan to the user for iteration (include the impact report).
7. Spawn an agent via the Agent tool with `subagent_type="ddw-arch-auditor"` to validate the
   proposed architecture (do NOT read AGENT.md as a file). Accept its report only with its
   closing line (`HALLAZGOS: <N> — lista completa`, count matching what it lists) — a report
   without it was cut mid-write: relaunch, never fill the gap yourself.

### Impact Check (Step 5 — mandatory)

**Before presenting the plan to the user, systematically verify that the plan is complete.** You
cannot present a plan without this step.

**Delegate this check to the `ddw-impact-scanner` subagent** via the Agent tool with
`subagent_type="ddw-impact-scanner"`, passing it the draft plan, the spec and the conventions. Do
not run it inline: these are exhaustive searches across the whole codebase, and its intermediate
work — dozens of files read — would pollute the context right before the part that needs the most
reasoning. The subagent returns only the verdict.

The scanner runs these 5 checks:

1. **File existence:** for every file listed in every block, verify it exists in the codebase (or is
   marked "new"). If a file does not exist → the plan has an error.

2. **Siblings / parallel implementations:** if the plan modifies a concrete implementation (e.g.
   `sqlite.py`), search for ALL the other implementations of the same protocol/interface/abstract
   class (e.g. `rest.py`, `graphql.py`). If there are uncovered siblings → add them to the plan or
   explicitly justify why they are not touched.

3. **Callers / call sites:** for every function or method whose signature the plan changes (adds
   parameters, changes types, etc.), find ALL the call sites in the codebase. If there are callers
   not covered by the plan → add them.

4. **Exports / imports:** if the plan adds new functions or classes to a module, check whether there
   is an `__init__.py` or barrel file that needs updating. If exports are missing → add them to the
   plan.

5. **Similar patterns:** if the plan modifies a pattern in one file (e.g. adding a permission check
   in `routes/users.py`), look for other files with the same pattern that also need the change (e.g.
   `routes/people.py`, `routes/auth.py`). Search with grep/glob, not from memory.

**Format of the report the scanner returns (include it when presenting the plan):**

```

│                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**If gaps are found:** fold them into the plan BEFORE presenting. Do not present a plan with known
gaps.

### Threat Modeling (MANDATORY for FEATURE)

Run `ddw-threat-modeling` on the proposed design, applying **every rule in section 3 of
`.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md`** (F-TM-01 to F-TM-07, W-TM-01 to W-TM-02):
- STRIDE analysis per component (F-TM-01).
- Trust boundary identification (F-TM-02).
- Every threat with a mitigation or a formally accepted risk (F-TM-03, F-TM-04).
- Sensitive data classification (F-TM-05).
- Reference to the spec's actual architecture, not generic boilerplate (F-TM-06).
- Encryption specified for PII/credentials (F-TM-07).
- If it finds CRITICAL/HIGH risks → fold the mitigations into the spec before writing it.

**Write the model here; validate it after the spec exists.** The threat model is written before the
spec on purpose — it is the last step that can still add files to the plan, and it regularly does.
But F-TM-06 checks the model against the spec's real architecture, so running the validator before
the spec has been written fails it every time, by construction: the document it compares against is
not there yet. That red is the documented path producing a failure nobody can act on, which is worse
than no check at all — it teaches the reader to discount a rule that is doing its job.

So the order within this phase is: write the model → fold its mitigations into the spec → write the
spec → run `validate_threat.py --spec docs/ddw/specs/spec-{ticket}.md`. Nothing is skipped and
nothing is softened: F-TM-06 still has to pass against the real design, and it now can.

Result: `gates.threat` = `true`. The report is saved to `docs/ddw/security/threat-{ticket}.md` — in the
template `ddw-threat-modeling` defines, because `validate_threat.py` parses that structure and a
model nothing can parse is a model nothing can check. A PASSED run of that script writes
`.ddw-sessions/threat-validated-<hash>`, and **the `threat` gate asks for it**: the boolean alone no
longer opens PLAN→CODE, and editing the model afterwards costs another run.

### Creating / updating the Spec

**NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE:** generating or modifying the spec is done EXCLUSIVELY through the
`ddw-create-spec` skill. **Writing the spec inline from the agent is forbidden** — the skill
encapsulates the template, naming, location, `Spec loops` handling, update mode (which preserves
completed blocks) and output format.

- **New spec** (`docs/ddw/specs/spec-{ticket}.md` does not exist): invoke the skill via the Skill tool
  with `skill="ddw-create-spec"` in FEATURE creation mode (do NOT write inline, do NOT read SKILL.md
  as a file). The skill generates `docs/ddw/specs/spec-{ticket}.md` with the standard template and the
  data from the state.
- **Existing spec needing changes** (a FAILED loop, a PLAN ↔ DEFINE corrective loop, new
  requirements from the PRD): invoke the skill via the Skill tool with `skill="ddw-create-spec"` in
  update mode (do NOT modify inline, do NOT read SKILL.md as a file). The skill reads the existing
  spec, appends new blocks at the end with sequential numbering, preserves completed blocks (`[x]`),
  and increments `Spec loops`.

### Canonical template
The spec's template is defined by the `ddw-create-spec` skill. **It is not duplicated here**, to
avoid drift between sources. The path is `docs/ddw/specs/spec-{ticket}.md` (defined in
`.ddw/rules/branches.instructions.md`).

### Post-write validation
- The skill automatically runs `ddw-validate-spec` at the end of its execution, applying **every
  rule in section 2 of `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md`** (F-SPEC-01 to F-SPEC-16,
  W-SPEC-01 to W-SPEC-03). The rules are evaluated mechanically — no subjective interpretation.
  **100% coverage of the PRD's FRs is mandatory (F-SPEC-01): if an FR is not covered by any block →
  FAIL, not WARNING.**
- **If FAILED (there are FAILs):**
  - Present the FAILs to the user with options: (a) fix the spec to cover what is missing, (b)
    modify the PRD to remove/defer the requirement (requires re-approving the PRD).
  - Wait for the user's decision.
  - If they fix the spec → re-invoke the skill via the Skill tool with `skill="ddw-create-spec"` in
    update mode to fold in the corrections (do NOT modify inline; the skill increments `Spec loops`
    and re-runs `ddw-validate-spec`).
  - If they modify the PRD → corrective loop back to DEFINE (see the protocol).
  - Repeat until PASSED (0 FAILs).
- Count the spec's blocks so you can set `block` in the state on transition.

---

## If tier == FIX

### Inputs
- The fix description from the state's `title`
- The related PRD (if any) at `docs/ddw/prd/prd-{ticket}.md`
- The project's stack: the "Stack" section of `AGENTS.md`

### Design Process
1. Analyze the problem in the code.
2. Identify the root cause.
3. Identify the files affected.
4. Design the correction.
5. **Impact check** (apply the same 5 checks as FEATURE — see the section above). For FIX, the most
   relevant checks are: siblings (other implementations), callers (functions with a modified
   signature), and similar patterns.
6. Run `ddw-threat-modeling` on the proposed design.
7. Present it to the user for approval (include the impact report).

> **Stability over elegance.** A FIX resolves a defect; it is not the moment to refactor. If it is
> a live production bug, prioritize the minimal correction and leave the cleanup for its own ticket.

### Creating / updating the Fix-Plan

**NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE:** generating or modifying the fix-plan is done EXCLUSIVELY through the
`ddw-create-spec` skill. **Writing the fix-plan inline from the agent is forbidden** — the skill
encapsulates the template, naming, location and format.

- **New fix-plan:** invoke the skill via the Skill tool with `skill="ddw-create-spec"` in FIX
  creation mode (do NOT write inline, do NOT read SKILL.md as a file). The skill generates
  `docs/ddw/specs/fix-{ticket}.md` from the fix-plan template, which includes the **Rollback plan**
  section and a reference to the RCA written in DEFINE.
- **Existing fix-plan needing changes** (a FAILED loop, new findings from the analysis): invoke the
  skill via the Skill tool with `skill="ddw-create-spec"` in update mode (do NOT modify inline, do
  NOT read SKILL.md as a file). The skill reads the existing fix-plan and applies the changes.

### Canonical template
The fix-plan's template is defined by the `ddw-create-spec` skill. **It is not duplicated here.** The
path is `docs/ddw/specs/fix-{ticket}.md`.

### Post-write validation
- The skill automatically runs `ddw-validate-spec`, applying the applicable rules from section 2 of
  `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` (F-SPEC-10, F-SPEC-11, F-SPEC-14 and F-SPEC-15 are
  mandatory for fix-plans).
- **If FAILED:** present the FAILs and re-invoke the skill via the Skill tool with
  `skill="ddw-create-spec"` in update mode to fold in the corrections (do NOT modify inline). Repeat
  until PASSED.
- There are no blocks in a fix-plan, so `block` stays `null`.

---

## Transition (applies to all tiers)

Requirements to advance:
1. The spec/fix-plan file exists on disk.
2. `ddw-validate-spec` returned **PASSED** (0 FAILs per rules F-SPEC-01 to F-SPEC-16 of
   `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md`), which leaves
   `.ddw-sessions/spec-validated-<hash>` — and the `spec` gate asks for a receipt matching the
   spec's **current** bytes, so an edit after validating means validating again.
3. `ddw-threat-modeling` has run → `gates.threat` == `true`, with its own receipt.
4. The user approved the spec/fix-plan, **having seen the validator's whole checklist** — every rule
   ID with its ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ — and the link to `<artifact>.validation.md`. An approval given on a
   summary is an approval of the summary.

## Re-entry from CODE (the spec was wrong)

CODE does not rewrite the spec — the write gate refuses it while the `spec` gate stands — so a spec
error found during implementation comes back here. `.ddw/rules/code.instructions.md` owns the trip;
this is the half that happens on arrival.

- **`block` is not yours.** It stays exactly as CODE left it: the return is to the same block, and
  resetting it turns a corrective loop into a restart.
- **Correct only what the discrepancy is about.** Coming back with a spec that also grew three
  improvements nobody asked for makes the re-approval meaningless — the user cannot tell what they
  are agreeing to.
- **Re-validate** with `ddw-validate-spec` (and the threat model if the change touches it — its gate
  came off too and is re-earned the same way). `Spec loops` goes up; `Loops since last human
  decision` resets only when a person decides something, and returning from CODE is the model's
  finding, not theirs.
- **The banner says where it came from.** An approval that does not know it is a re-approval is a
  rubber stamp, so the ask carries the origin and the reason:

  ```
  🙋 TU TURNO — ¿Aprobás la spec corregida?
     Volvimos de CODE (Block 2): [the discrepancy, in one line]
     Cambió: [what the spec says now that it did not say before]
     Al confirmar: PLAN → CODE, se re-ganan `spec` y `threat`, y sigue el Block 2
  ```

Wait for the user's explicit confirmation.
> **Under `autonomy: "minimal"` this arrow does not wait.** The state is still
> written, the gates are still owed and still refused by the hook, and the
> closing box is still shown — what goes away is the pause for a confirmation of
> something a receipt already attests. Three things stop the run anyway, in
> either mode: a decision nobody wrote down, a corrective loop at its ceiling,
> and a corrupt state. See `.ddw/orchestrator.md` § Autonomy.

### On confirmation:

1. **Commit this phase's artifacts** with `Skill(skill="ddw-commit")`: the spec/fix-plan, the threat
   model, and the ADR if one was written. Documentation commit — `📝 docs`, no source code. The
   design is on the record before a single line gets written against it.
2. Update `.ddw-state.json`:
- `phase` → `"CODE"`
- Add `"spec": true` and `"threat": true` to `gates`
- `block` → `"1/{total}"` (for FEATURE with blocks, indicating the current block) or `null` (for
  FIX)
- Add an entry to `history`: transition PLAN → CODE, **stamped with `ticket` and `tier`** (see `.ddw/rules/state.instructions.md`)

---

**FORBIDDEN in this phase:**
- Writing product source code
- Modifying the PRD
- Committing anything other than this phase's own artifacts (never source code)
- Creating PRs
- Running code tests
