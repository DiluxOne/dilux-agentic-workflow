"""DDW FSM transition validation.

Two modes (same graph, same `validate()`):

- `--mode pre` (PreToolUse, default): reads the event from stdin; if the target
  is .ddw-state.json, validates disk→new (reconstructed from tool_input) BEFORE
  the write lands. Covers Edit|Write|NotebookEdit (the hook's matcher).
- `--mode post` (PostToolUse): ignores the event; revalidates the state ON DISK
  as a complete chain from IDLE (the `history` IS the chain, no external
  reference needed) after any tool — including Bash/jq, which the PreToolUse
  matcher never sees. Illegal → exit 2 (does not undo, it stops). Tool-agnostic,
  path-agnostic, stateless.

exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block (with the reason on stderr). Validation is
anchored on the history entries that were APPENDED, not on the phase on disk:
the model does not always persist an intermediate CLASSIFY.

# ── The source-code guard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The FSM stops you ENTERING the phase where code gets written without the gates.
# On its own that is not enough: an agent that never bothers to transition can
# write code from PLAN, and "no approved spec, no code" — the one rule this
# pipeline exists to guarantee — collapses into a line in a prompt.
#
# Phases whose rules forbid touching product source. CLOSEOUT is not here: it
# writes the CHANGELOG and its own gates already close it. FREE is not here
# either, and that is the whole point of FREE.
#
# IDLE IS here now, and its absence was the hole the paragraph above predicts,
# one phase further out. "An agent that never bothers to transition can write
# code from PLAN" — and an agent that never CLASSIFIES writes it from where
# every session already starts, which needs no transition at all. Measured in a
# real session: asked plainly, the model classified and refused to code; told
# "no ticket, just write it", it wrote the file, both hooks green, the state
# still IDLE and no record anywhere that a line of product code had been
# written. Every other hole this repository has closed took a trick — a symlink,
# a placeholder, a backdated clock. This one took nothing.
#
# The point is not that the code was written. It is that it was written with
# nobody having decided to. Which is why the way out is not a loophole but a
# tier: `--tier FREE` is a transition, in the history, with a timestamp and a
# reason, and the session says ESTÁS TRABAJANDO SIN WORKFLOW for as long as it
# lasts. A user who wants no pipeline gets exactly that, on the record.
#
# What stays writable at IDLE is what a repo at rest legitimately needs: the
# context files and the CHANGELOG, each tool's wiring, and everything under
# `docs/` — so installing, ejecting, reading and writing documents need no
# ticket.

    guarded file being written under an unguarded name. But the sealed lists are
    about NAMES — `.ddw/`, `.ddw-sessions/`, `.claude/settings.json` — and
    resolving first answers the question about a different name. With `.ddw`
    made a symlink to a directory outside the repository, writes to
    `.ddw/rules/transition-graph.json` and `.ddw/scripts/hook-gate.py` resolved
    outside, so `enforcement_write_denied` said "not ours" and returned 0, while

    under another name, and this one catches another file reached under a
    guarded name. Neither subsumes the other.

    One thing IS resolved here, and only one: the repository root itself. `root`
    arrives already resolved, and a root can perfectly well be written through a
    symlink of its own — `/var` is `/private/var` on every macOS, which is where
    a temporary checkout lives, and a repo behind a symlinked path is ordinary
    anywhere. Compared as written, such a path sits "outside the repository" for
    the whole of its length, so every sealed name under it went unjudged and
    this reading protected nothing on that platform. Measured: the seal held on
    Linux and not on macOS, in CI, from the same source.

# ── The two decisions, in one place each ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# Everything above is machinery; these two functions are the policy. They exist
# so that the CLI below and ddw/scripts/hook-gate.py — which is what the six
# tools actually run — cannot drift apart. They did: the caller had to opt into
# `max_appended`, and hook-gate did not, so one Write could declare the whole
# pipeline on every tool while this file's own CLI refused it.
#
# Both return None to allow, or a human-readable reason to refuse.

# ── What a gate rests on ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `validate()` asks whether a gate is claimed. That is a question about the state
# and nothing else, which is why it stays a pure function the suite can drive
# with synthetic runs. This asks the other question — whether anything outside
# the model backs the claim — and it needs the repository, so it lives out here
# where the root is known.
#
# All eight gates have an answer, and they are not the same answer — which is the
# distinction this comment used to get wrong. It said five, and named `tests`,
# `sast` and `pr` as claims nothing could confirm, sixty lines above the handlers
# that confirm them.
#
#   six of them  resolve a content-hashed receipt over the document the phase
#                produced, so what is attested is that the DOCUMENT is complete —
#                never that the work it describes was done. DDW does not run your
#                suite and does not scan your code.
#   `commit`     asks git.
#   `pr`         asks the forge, through `gh`.
#
# That split is a decision rather than an unfinished job, and `docs/RATIONALE.md`
# decision 16 has the table.

    A repo whose STATE already holds transitions is not that repo. There, a

    post mode STRICTER; this is that promise reaching the receipts. The cost is
    re-running the validators that earned them, which is the same cost the
    upgrade path already pays, and the refusal says so.

    Where there IS a journal, the answer is the set, even when it is empty. A
    repo upgrading mid-run therefore has to re-run its validators, and the

    plugin one: there the method sits in a plugin root shared by every project,
    and every guard on DDW's own files answered "outside the repo, not ours".
    Measured: writes to the plugin's `transition-graph.json`, `hook-gate.py` and

    "not ours". Measured: overwriting that one `.sh` with `exit 0` took a single
    `Write`, allowed in any phase including IDLE, after which a write to
    `src/x.py` that had just been refused came back at exit 0 — DDW off, in

# "NEVER run more than one phase transition in a single response. Finish the
# current phase, show the closing summary, wait for EXPLICIT confirmation."
# The orchestrator states it as hard, and said how it was enforced: "the state
# is written once per arrow either way, and the hook refuses a write that
# appends two."
#
# That covers one of the two ways to break it. Measured on a live run: three
# separate writes, one entry each, thirty-seven seconds apart, on a single
# "avanti" — the split closed, the sub-ticket opened, and DEFINE entered, with
# the user having approved only the first. Each write was legal on its own and
# nothing compares writes across a response.
#
# The turn counter the commit gate needed is the signal that was missing. Under
# `minimal` this does not apply: there the arrows are supposed to run without
# anyone between them, which is what that mode was opted into.
