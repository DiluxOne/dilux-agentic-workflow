"""ddw-validate-prd, the mechanical half — run by the skill, never re-derived.

Why a script: the skill's box template was already exact, and a live Copilot
run loaded create-prd and validate-prd together as background reading and
"validated" in free prose — theater with a green tint. A report a model renders
is a report a model can skip; a report a script prints is either there or the
command failed. The judgement rules (F-PRD-02 non-binary wording, F-PRD-07
undeclared cross-references, W-PRD-01/03) stay with the model and are printed
as MANUAL lines so their absence is visible instead of silent.

Rules mirror `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §1 — the catalog is
the source of truth; this file implements, it does not redefine.
