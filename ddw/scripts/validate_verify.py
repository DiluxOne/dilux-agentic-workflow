"""ddw-verify-module, the mechanical half — run by the skill, never re-derived.

**Read this before assuming what the receipt means.** DDW does not run your test
suite: it does not know whether this is pytest or jest or a monorepo with five
runners, and a gate that cannot be satisfied honestly gets satisfied dishonestly
(docs/RATIONALE.md decisions 2 and 16). So this script does NOT verify that the
tests pass. It verifies that **the verdict was written and is complete** — that
every AC in the PRD is accounted for, every block or fix-plan step is accounted for,
the three coverage numbers are stated and meet the minimum the rules set, and
lint and the sad paths have an answer instead of a silence.

That is a smaller claim than "verified", and it is the whole claim. The numbers
in the report are still the model's report of what it ran. What changes is that
a VERIFY phase can no longer close with a verdict that never mentions half the
acceptance criteria — which is what the `verify` boolean allowed, and what a
reader six months later would have had no way to notice.

Rules mirror `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §5 — the catalog is
the source of truth; this file implements, it does not redefine.

Exit: 0 = PASSED (warnings allowed) · 2 = FAILED · 3 = cannot read/parse.

    Two things are deliberate here, and both were paid for.

    **Where it looks.** Scanning the whole document for anything starting with

    no test at all, counted as one. Round 6 measured the result: "all 19 test(s)

    16. Worse than the wrong number was what it taught: the FAIL before it was
    closed by adding the FILE NAMES to the report, which is precisely what this
    rule had misread. A count nobody can reproduce is the same defect as a count
    measured from nothing, one direction over.

    **What counts as a name.** A path is not a test. `tests/test_x.py::test_y`
    keeps the half after `::` — that IS a test — and what is left has to be an
    identifier, which no path can be. The optional backtick is not decoration
