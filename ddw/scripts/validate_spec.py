"""ddw-validate-spec, the mechanical half — run by the skill, never re-derived.

Why a script, when the skill already printed a box: because a box a model renders
is a box a model can compress. It happened in a live run — nineteen rules, a
PASSED verdict, and two lines of chat with the rule names squeezed out. Nothing
lied; the reader simply never saw what was checked.

`validate_prd.py` answered that for the PRD and left the spec where it started:
the largest rule family in the catalog (F-SPEC-01…16, W-SPEC-01…03) judged
entirely by the model, with no artifact on disk and nothing binding the verdict
to the bytes that earned it. This file closes that gap the same way, so the two
read alike and the `spec` gate can rest on a receipt instead of a boolean.

What stays with the model is what a parser cannot honestly answer: whether the
design CONTRADICTS the PRD (F-SPEC-12) and whether the terminology DIVERGES from
it (F-SPEC-13). Both are printed as MANUAL lines so their absence is visible
rather than silent — the same contract validate_prd.py uses.

Rules mirror `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §2 — the catalog is
the source of truth; this file implements, it does not redefine.

Exit: 0 = PASSED (warnings allowed) · 2 = FAILED · 3 = cannot read/parse.
