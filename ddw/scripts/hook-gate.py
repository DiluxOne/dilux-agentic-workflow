"""The single enforcement entry point every tool's hook calls.

Each tool speaks its own dialect twice over: the shape of the event it hands a
hook, and the way that hook says "deny". Everything in between — is this write
touching the state file, is the transition legal, which gate is missing, may
this phase write source at all — is the same question, and it is answered once,
in `validate-transition.py`, by `decide_pre()` and `decide_post()`.

**This file contains no policy.** It translates an envelope in and a verdict
out. That rule is not tidiness: two copies of the same decision drift, and the
copy that runs is not necessarily the copy that gets reasoned about — or tested.
Anything this file decides for itself is a second implementation of the FSM.

    hook-gate.py --dialect copilot --mode pre --state … --graph … --repo …

`--mode post` ignores the event entirely and revalidates the state on disk,
which is how the Bash/jq bypass gets caught on every tool, not just one.
