"""Work out what DAW put in this repo, and take exactly that back out.

The hard part of an uninstaller is not deleting things. It is knowing what is
yours. `.claude/` is not DAW's directory — it is Claude Code's, and your own
skills and hooks live there too. Removing it wholesale would be the same defect
the installer spends its whole life avoiding, run in reverse and with no undo.

So this reads `.daw-installed.json`, which lists every file DAW wrote and what
it looked like. A file still matching its recorded fingerprint is DAW's and goes.
A file that has changed is one you edited, and it stays unless you say otherwise.
Anything not in the manifest was never DAW's and is not touched.

`docs/` is never removed. The PRDs, specs, threat models and verification
reports are the record of what was decided and why — the whole reason they are
committed instead of living in a chat. Uninstalling the tool is not a reason to
lose them.

`--plan` prints what would happen and writes nothing.
