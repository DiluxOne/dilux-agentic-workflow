"""Which check of `lint_method.py` does each fault provoke — the kill map, one
level down.

`scripts/verify_install.sh` has ONE check for the whole prose linter ("the
method's prose claims something the repo does not support"). So in
`docs/CHECKS-THAT-CANNOT-FAIL.md` the linter's thirty-odd `fail()` sites collapse
into a single line: as long as any fault keeps `lint_method.py` red, a check
inside it that stopped finding what it was written for goes on reporting green,
and the ledger says the check is covered. That is the exact defect the ledger
exists to catch, one layer below where it can see.

So this asks the same question the kill map asks, about the linter itself:

    apply each fault to a copy → run the linter → record WHICH message came out

What never comes out is a check of the linter that no fault provokes. That does
not prove it cannot fail — it proves nothing measures whether it can. Either
write a fault that makes it fire, or write here why there is not one. Same
contract as the other ledger, same reason.

    python3 scripts/lint_kill_map.py --repo .            # measure and compare
    python3 scripts/lint_kill_map.py --repo . --write    # regenerate the ledger

Exit 0 = every site either fires or carries a written reason. Exit 1 = a site
fires nothing and nobody has said why, or the ledger excuses a site that now
fires. Exit 2 = the instrument could not measure.

# The first version instead listed the extensions the linter DOES read

# fault exists to light up kept coming out as "nothing provokes them" right

    The first version recognised each site by a literal piece of its message,

      · A `fail()` with `%s` inside does NOT print `%s`, it prints the value.
        Taking the whole format string as the literal, that site can never
        match and comes out as "no mutation provokes it" with the mutation
        existing — it happened to the boot check, which has had its own since
        b605648. The same measurement error the kill map committed five times.
      · Splitting on the placeholders, TEN sites were left with no long
        literal stretch at all: messages that are almost pure interpolation.
        Demanding a ledger excuse for them would have recorded an instrument's
        ceiling as a product hole.
