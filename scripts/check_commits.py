"""Hold this repository's commits to the attribution rule it publishes.

`daw/rules/commits.instructions.md` requires one of two trailers on any commit
produced with AI assistance, and forbids `Co-Authored-By` by name. The
distinction is the point, not the spelling:

**`Co-Authored-By: <a model>` claims co-authorship.** Authorship is where
responsibility sits, so a trailer naming the tool as an author spreads it onto
something that cannot hold it — and "the AI wrote it" is exactly the answer
`docs/AI-POLICY.md` opens by refusing to accept.

**`AI-assisted: yes` records assistance.** It says a model helped and a human
read, understood and approved the result. One author, who signed; a disclosure
of how the work was done. `AI-full: yes` is the same disclosure for a change
generated end to end — still owned by whoever committed it.

That rule applied to every repository DAW is installed in and to nothing here,
and a framework exempting itself from its own commit convention is an argument
against itself, made in public, in its own history.

    python3 scripts/check_commits.py --since origin/main [--repo .]

Only the range is checked: history before the rule cannot be rewritten without
breaking every clone, and rewriting it is not what makes the next commit right.

Exit 0 = every commit in the range is attributed. Exit 1 = at least one is not.

    every dependency PR red until someone rewrote the bot's message by hand —
