"""Check the method's prose against the method's data.

DAW's product is mostly prompts. That makes a whole class of defect invisible to
ordinary testing: a rule cites a validation ID that no longer exists, a phase
promises an artifact nothing writes, a skill names a gate the graph never
carries, two files state different counts of the same thing. Nothing crashes.
The model simply reads the wrong instruction and does the wrong thing, and no
test notices because there is nothing to execute.

So this is the linter for the parts that are text. It compares what the prose
claims against the graph, the rule catalog and the filesystem — the three places
that hold the truth — and fails on any claim it cannot back up.
