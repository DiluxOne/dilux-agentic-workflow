"""Break DDW on purpose, one fault at a time, and see whether the suite notices.

A test suite that always passes and a test suite that cannot fail look exactly
alike from the outside. The only way to tell them apart is to introduce a defect
you know is real and check that something goes red. That is all this is.

Each mutation below describes a defect class this design is built to prevent —
not a hypothetical, but a way these guards are known to fail. If a mutation survives, the suite has a blind spot at
exactly that spot — and the fix is a new check, not a smaller mutation list.

    python3 scripts/mutate.py            # run them all, print the kill rate
    python3 scripts/mutate.py --list     # just show what would run
    python3 scripts/mutate.py --only 3 7 # run a subset while iterating

Exit 0 when every mutation is killed. Exit 1 when any survives: a surviving
mutation is a hole, and the number is the project's real coverage figure.

Running the whole suite once per fault takes hours in one process, and a CI job
that cannot finish inside its timeout is a measurement nobody ever reads. So the
run splits:

    python3 scripts/mutate.py --shard 3/10           # one slice, in its own job
    python3 scripts/mutate.py --cover <workflow.yml> # do the slices cover it all?
    python3 scripts/mutate.py --check-anchors        # do they all still apply?

Splitting a measurement is how a measurement goes quietly missing — a matrix
that loses an entry leaves faults nobody injects, and every job that did run is
still green. `--cover` reads the workflow and adds the slices back up, so the
workflow has to prove it ran the whole list rather than assert it.

Where no turn hook is wired, the gate stands down and\nsays so here rather than reading as coverage.
