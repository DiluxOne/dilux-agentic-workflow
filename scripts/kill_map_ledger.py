"""The ledger of the checks no fault ever provokes.

`scripts/mutate.py --kill-map` records, for every fault, WHICH suite check
caught it. Crossed against every `bad` that `scripts/verify_install.sh` knows
how to say, what remains are the checks no fault provokes. Of those, nobody
knows whether they CAN fail — and a check that cannot fail reports green
because it has nothing else to say, not because it looked at anything. Five
shipped in this repository: they were finding themselves, and they surfaced by
accident while running mutations.

This file is NOT a report. A generated report that gets committed and never
regenerated is lying within two weeks, and an unbacked claim is exactly what
the rest of this repository hunts down. It is an EXPECTATION: the list somebody
already looked at, with the reason beside each line, and CI compares it against
reality.

  · One appears that is not on the list  → red. Write down why, or write it
    a fault.
  · One on the list disappears           → red. It can be measured now; out.

It is the language of SAST suppressions, for the same reason: it forbids
nothing, it forces it to be said out loud.
