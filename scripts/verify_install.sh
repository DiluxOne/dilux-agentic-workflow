# A suite that can quietly run fewer checks is worse than no suite: it prints a
# green N/N either way, because the denominator moves with the numerator. A
# A `find` without `-printf`, an absent `md5sum`, a missing `node` — each one
# silently removes a section and leaves the exit code at 0. So: every optional
# dependency is asserted up front, a missing one is a FAILURE and not a skip,
# and the run ends by checking that the number of checks it performed is the
# number it was supposed to perform.
#
# The first two of those are no longer dependencies: asserting a GNU flag is
# present is a way of saying the suite runs a smaller version of itself on
# macOS, which is the thing this file refuses to do everywhere else. They are
# written portably instead, and the pinned total is what catches the next one.

## Context and Problem
Contexto minimo.

## Goals
- Reducir 30% el tiempo.

## Functional Requirements
- FR-01: El sistema debe exponer un formulario.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-01: Carga en < 3 s p95.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC-01 (FR-01): WHEN un usuario abre el formulario, THE sistema SHALL mostrarlo.
- AC-02 (FR-01): IF el envio falla, THEN THE sistema SHALL conservar el texto.

## Out of Scope
- Login de estudiantes.

## Dependencies
- Proveedor de IA.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Riesgo: spam.

## Summary
Formulario publico con persistencia.

## Coverage: PRD → blocks
| Requirement | Covered by |
|---|---|
| FR-01 | Block 1 |
| NFR-01 | Strategy: render server-side sin bundle JS, medido p95 bajo 3 s |

## Dependencies between blocks
Block 1 no depende de nadie.

## Block 1 — Formulario publico

**Files**
- `app/routes/public.py` (new) — rutas del formulario

**Logic**
Implementa FR-01.

**API contract**
- Method + path: `POST /tickets`
- Request: titulo (str), email (str)
- Response: id (int)
- Error codes: 400, 422
- Auth: publico, sin autenticacion

**Data model**
- Entidad ticket: id (PK), titulo (not null), estado (default "Pendiente"), index en estado.

**Input validation**
- titulo: str, max 200, requerido.

**Error handling**
- 400 cuando falta un campo requerido.
- 422 cuando el email tiene formato invalido.

**Required tests**
- [ ] test_form_visible — validates AC-01
- [ ] test_campo_faltante_devuelve_400 — validates AC-02, campo requerido faltante
- [ ] test_email_invalido_devuelve_422 — email con formato invalido

**Completion criterion**
Pasan los tres tests y el POST devuelve 201.

## Rollback
La tabla se crea vacia y se descarta; no hay migracion inversa.

## Problem
Al fallar la validacion, el formulario se re-renderiza vacio.

## Root cause
El handler construye un contexto nuevo en vez de reusar el body recibido.

## Solution — steps
1. `app/routes/public.py:42` — pasar el body al contexto de re-render.

## Dependencies between steps
Ninguna: es un solo paso.

## Error handling
- 422 con el formulario repoblado cuando el email es invalido.

## Tests
- test_regression_envio_invalido_conserva_texto — regression del bug original, entrada invalida.

## Rollback plan
Revertir el commit; el cambio es de una linea.

**Files**

**Logic**
Creates the table.

**Data model**
- Entity ticket: id (PK), titulo (not null), estado (default "Pendiente"), index on estado.

**Error handling**
- None — this block takes no input of its own.

**Required tests**
- [ ] test_schema — validates AC-01

**Completion criterion**
test_schema passes.

## Block 2 — listing
**Files**
- \`app/listing.py\` (new)

**Logic**
Reads the table Block 1 declares.

**Data model**
$REUSE

**Error handling**
- None — this block takes no input of its own.

**Required tests**
- [ ] test_listado — validates AC-02

**Completion criterion**
test_listado passes.

# ── Copilot: the gates ride USER-LEVEL hooks, in both install modes ──────────
#
# Copilot installs Claude-format plugins (skills included) and ignores their
# Claude-format hooks manifest — measured live: a forged state sailed through.
# Its channel is user-level hooks pointing at the method, so the hook scripts
# resolve repo-first, plugin-root second.
#
# And user level rather than the repo, because Copilot loads REPOSITORY hooks
# only in a folder the user has trusted — GitHub's reference says policy hooks
# work "regardless of folder trust state", which is the only place it says the
# others do not. Trust is answered in a dialog `-p` cannot show. Measured with
# `trustedFolders` as the only variable: trusted, the hooks ran and the write
# was refused; not trusted, zero ran and the file was written. The repo a
# developer opens interactively is trusted and enforces; the same repo on CI is
# not, and does not.
#
# There is no stand-down any more, and this section is where that is held. It
# used to read: the user-level copy keeps quiet where the repo wires its own
# hook. That was right only while a repo-level manifest existed to take over.
# DDW writes none, so a copy that stepped aside for a repo hook would be
# stepping aside for nothing. Standing down HERE means enforcing nowhere.

# hook, and a stand-down restored in `post-write.sh` alone would pass it while

#
# Two things this check had to be taught, and both are the difference between
# measuring the stand-down and measuring something else:
#
#   Post mode reads the DISK, not the event, so the forged state has to be
#   there — above, the pre hook refused the write and left no file behind.
#
#   And the verdict is not an exit code. GitHub documents Copilot's postToolUse
#   as unable to refuse: a non-zero exit is "logged and skipped". DDW answers it
#   in `additionalContext` instead, which the model heeds. So what separates a
#   net that ran from one that stood down is whether the finding is IN that
#   answer — a stand-down prints a bare `{}` and exits 0, and asking the exit
#   code calls both of them the same thing.
