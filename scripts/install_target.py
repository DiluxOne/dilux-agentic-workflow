"""Install DDW's wiring for one target, from that target's adapter recipe.

This engine knows nothing about Claude, OpenCode or Copilot. It reads
`adapters/<id>/adapter.json` and applies it. Supporting a new tool means adding
a directory with a recipe (and whatever hook scripts that tool needs) — no
change to this file.

What a recipe declares:

  skills.dir        where the tool looks for skills. The skills themselves live
                    once in skills/ and are copied there.
  agents.dir        where the tool looks for subagents.
  agents.filename   the tool's filename convention, e.g. "{name}.agent.md".
  agents.frontmatter  the tool's frontmatter dialect. Values are templates over
                    the neutral fields declared in agents/*.md
                    ({name}, {description}, {tools}).
  agents.when_readonly  extra frontmatter merged in for agents with writes:false
                    (tools that express permissions rather than a tool list).
  agents.format     "yaml" (default) or "toml" — Codex defines subagents as TOML
                    files, not markdown with frontmatter.
  commands.dir      where the tool looks for slash commands, for tools that do
                    NOT expose skills as `/name` on their own. One thin command
                    is generated per skill so the entry point is the same
                    sentence on every tool.
  skills_are_slash  true when the tool already exposes each skill as `/name`
                    (Claude Code does). Declaring neither means DDW's skills
                    exist but there is no `/ddw-status` — which the installer
                    now says out loud instead of printing one closing line that
                    promised slash commands everywhere.
  wiring[]          directories to copy verbatim: that tool's hook scripts.
  settings_merge    a JSON file to merge a key into, instead of overwrite.
  settings_merge.base  top-level keys to seed when creating that file (Cursor's
                    hooks.json carries a schema "version" beside the hooks).
  context_file      the file the activation snippet is appended to.

Never overwrites a skill or agent the user already has: on a name collision with
different content it reports and leaves theirs alone.
