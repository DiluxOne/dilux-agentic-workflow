"""Keep every fact this repo states twice honest.

Mostly that means versions, of which there are three kinds, and conflating them
is how they rot:

**The product's.** One number, in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and at the top of
the CHANGELOG. It is what someone installs and what the changelog talks about.

**A format's.** `transition-graph.json` carries `format_version` because a
program reads that file and may be handed an old one. The validator refuses a
major it does not know, which is what separates a version from a decoration.

**A rule's.** Each `daw/rules/*.instructions.md` carries its own. These are the
ones people argue about, and the argument is settled by whether anything checks
them: a number nobody verifies drifts, and this repo shipped `tracker` at 2.0.0
while the product said 1.0.0 — a lie sitting in a file the model reads.

So with `--since <ref>`: a rule file whose content changed and whose version did
not is an error. That is the deal that makes the number mean something, and it
costs a bump on every edit. Without the check the field is worse than absent,
because absent tells you nothing and stale tells you something false.

The licence is the same shape of problem without being a version: one grant in
LICENSE, restated in every manifest, and the restatement is what a registry and
an installer read. So it is checked here, against the file that grants it.
