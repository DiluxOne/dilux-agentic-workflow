"""The eval harness, asked directly.

`evals/runner.py` is the instrument the instruction layer is measured with,
and an instrument nobody measures reports whatever. The scenarios exercise it
end to end — each one stands up a repo, installs the method and runs the
verdict — so they cost minutes: here go the capabilities of the harness
itself, which can be asked in milliseconds and are precisely the ones that,
broken silently, make a scenario pass for the wrong reason.

The three tested here arrived together and for the same reason: without them,
a whole family of scenarios could be written but not judged.

  · `given.files` — seeding the tree. Before, only `.daw-state.json` could be
    written, so every scenario about a source file that already exists started
    from the fixture's empty repo — that is, measuring something else.
  · `expect.file_matches` — asserting on the CONTENT. `files_present` cannot
    tell the document that answers the question from the one that makes it
    up: both exist.
  · `kind: method-lint` — `lint_method.py` as a verdict, with its control.
