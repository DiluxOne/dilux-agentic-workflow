"""The validators and the session boot, asked directly.

Sibling of `test_validate_transition.py` and with the same limited scope: this
does NOT replace `scripts/verify_install.sh`, which installs into a real repo,
sends a real event to a real hook and reads the verdict the tool would read.
What it proves is that the rules say what they mean, which is the half that
costs nothing to ask often.

Everything in this file came out of the same place: running the suite under
`coverage` with `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` — which also measures subprocesses,
and the validators and the hooks ARE subprocesses — and looking at which lines
never execute once. They are enforcement rules, not error branches: a warning
that the installed enforcement is no longer what was installed, and the expiry
of the security report that opens a gate.

### Option 1: CAPTCHA de un tercero
- **Pros:** frena bots conocidos
- **Cons:** suma un tercero a la carga inicial

- Un aula detrás de una sola IP puede toparse con el límite.
