"""The enforcement core, asked directly instead of through a repository.

`scripts/verify_install.sh` is the measurement that matters: it installs into a
real repo, sends a real event to a real hook, and reads the verdict the tool
would read. It costs eighty-five seconds, and `scripts/mutate.py` pays that once
per fault — four hundred and forty times.

This file is the other end of that trade. `validate-transition.py` is ~2,700
lines of which most is functions that take dictionaries and return a verdict, and
114 of the 440 faults are injected into it. Asked directly, the same questions
answer in milliseconds.

**It does not replace the suite and must not be read as covering what the suite
covers.** Nothing here proves a hook fires, an envelope is shaped as the tool
sends it, or an installer wrote what it said. What it proves is that the rules
say what they mean, which is the half that costs nothing to ask often.

The assertions are about VERDICTS — refused or allowed, and what the refusal
names — never about how the verdict is reached. A test that pins the internals
is a second implementation to keep in step, and this repository already carries
the scars of having the same rule written twice.

# that declares `## Repo family` owes the verdict file AND its content-hashed
# receipt (family_impact.py --validate writes it over facts gathered fresh
# from every member's origin). No family section → the gate never speaks.
