# Repo first, plugin second. Same reasoning as pre-tool-use.sh, including why
# there is no stand-down.
# There is no stand-down here any more, and there must not be one. It read: if
# this is the user-level copy and the repo wires its own hook, keep quiet —
# which was right only while a repo-level manifest existed to take over. DAW
# writes none: Copilot loads repository hooks only in a folder the user has
# trusted, and `-p` cannot ask for trust, so the gates live at user level ONLY.
# A copy that steps aside for a repo hook steps aside for nothing at all.
