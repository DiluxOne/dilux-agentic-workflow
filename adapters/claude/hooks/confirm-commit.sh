# Hands a `git commit` to the user for approval while autonomy is `assisted`.
# `daw-commit` has always said "present the message for approval; only after
# approval create the commit", and `assisted` says every step waits — but the
# pre matcher only ever covered Edit|Write|NotebookEdit, so a commit is the one
# act in the pipeline that nothing enforced. It ran, and the user read the hash
# afterwards. The decision is the method's and is made once for every tool in
# .daw/scripts/hook-gate.py; this wrapper only supplies what is true of Claude
# Code: where the project root comes from.
