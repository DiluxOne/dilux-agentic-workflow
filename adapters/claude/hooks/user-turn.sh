# Counts the turns the user takes. Nothing else reads a human's presence: the
# commit gate holds a commit until this counter moves, which is what "assisted
# waits for the user" means once it has to be enforced rather than asked for.
#
# Prints nothing, ever: whatever a UserPromptSubmit hook writes to stdout is
# prepended to the user's own message.
