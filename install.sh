# install.sh — install DAW (Dilux Agentic Workflow) into any repo.
#
#   bash install.sh [/path/to/repo] [--target <tool>|all] [--mode plugin|dropin]
#
# Two ways in. `--mode plugin` hands the job to each tool's own plugin CLI and
# wires what a manifest cannot carry (Copilot's gates are user-level hooks);
# it covers Claude Code, Copilot CLI and OpenCode. `--mode dropin` copies the
# method into the repo and works for all six tools. Without --mode it always
# asks — naming a tool does not answer this — and falls to drop-in only where
# there is no terminal to ask on, saying so when it does.
#
# The same command installs and updates. On a repo that already has DDW it says
# so, defaults to refreshing the tools already wired there, and names any it is
# leaving behind.
#
# Tools are discovered from adapters/: claude, codex, copilot, cursor, gemini,
# opencode. Pass several with commas.
#
# Without --target it asks. Without a path it uses the current directory.
# Idempotent.
#
# It always installs the METHOD into `.ddw/` — identical for every tool — and
# then the WIRING for the target(s) you pick. Skills and agents have exactly one
# source (skills, agents); each adapter only declares where its tool
# looks for them and what frontmatter dialect it speaks.
#
# Supporting a new tool: create adapters/<id>/adapter.json (plus that tool's
# hook scripts). This script and the install engine stay untouched — the target
# list below is discovered from the adapters directory.

# The installer is not self-sufficient: it copies `ddw/`, `adapters/`,
# `scripts/` and the manifest from its own tree. A line pasted into a terminal
# has none of the four — and until today it did not even get to say so: under
# `bash -s` the variable `BASH_SOURCE[0]` does not exist, and with `set -u`
# that is an "unbound variable" on the next line, without a word about what
# happened.
#
# So if it cannot find itself, it fetches the tree and re-runs from there. It
# is the rustup and nvm pattern, for the same reason: the line someone pastes
# has to BE the installer, not a step before the installer. The plugin path
# was already one line and the drop-in demanded cloning first, which is the
# only door three of the six tools have.
#
# `DDW_REF` chooses what gets fetched. `main` by default, and that is a debt
# said out loud: `release.yml` cuts releases with `v*` tags and none has been
# cut yet, so today there is no version to point at.

    1) Plugin   — your tool fetches and manages it. Nothing of DDW is

                  Available for Claude Code, Copilot CLI and OpenCode.
    2) Drop-in  — the method is copied into this repo, under .ddw/. Your
                  teammates get it on clone, and you can edit the rules.
                  Available for all six tools.

    AGENTS.md            a short activation block appended at the end
    .gitignore           a block so the pipeline's runtime is never committed

    Your code and your documents. If you already have a file whose name DDW

       to know which commands are yours; guessing them is not allowed.
    2. Open your agent in this repo. The pipeline activates on its own, on
       your first message. You do not have to invoke it.
    3. Ask for the work you want done, in your own words. It classifies the
       request and takes it from there, one step at a time, waiting for you
       at each one.
