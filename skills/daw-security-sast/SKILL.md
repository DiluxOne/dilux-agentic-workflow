# Skill: /daw-security-sast

## Description
Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Scans the code for security vulnerabilities.
**BLOCKING GATE** — the `sast` receipt is what lets a ticket leave CODE: to VERIFY in
FEATURE and FIX, straight to CLOSEOUT in QUICK-FIX. No tier leaves it with open
vulnerabilities.

## Inputs
- The files modified during implementation.
- `.daw/rules/security.instructions.md` for the practices.
- `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §4 for the rules (F-SAST-01 to F-SAST-19,
  W-SAST-01) — the single source of truth for severity and disposition.
- The project's stack: the "Stack" section of `AGENTS.md`.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Scan for hardcoded secrets** (F-SAST-01, always Critical):
   - Look for API key, password, token and connection string patterns.
   - Check that `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
   - Look for sensitive files that should not be in the repo.

2. **Scan for injection patterns:**
   - SQL/NoSQL: string concatenation in queries; user objects passed straight into queries
     (F-SAST-02, Critical).
   - Command injection: user input reaching exec/spawn/system (F-SAST-03, Critical).
   - Path traversal: user input in file paths (F-SAST-05, High).

3. **Scan for XSS** (F-SAST-06, High):
   - `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user input.
   - Missing sanitization on HTML output.

4. **Scan for unsafe functions and broken crypto:**
   - `eval()`, `exec()`, insecure deserialization (F-SAST-04 Critical / F-SAST-17 Medium, depending
     on whether the input is controlled).
   - Weak crypto: MD5/SHA1 for passwords, DES, ECB mode (F-SAST-08, High).

5. **Scan the rest of the mandatory categories:** SSRF (F-SAST-07), debug mode in production
   (F-SAST-09), logging of sensitive data (F-SAST-10), unrestricted upload (F-SAST-11), missing CSRF
   protection (F-SAST-12). Then the two Medium code categories, which the scan protocol used to
   skip past entirely: incomplete input validation (F-SAST-14) and error handling that leaks
   internals (F-SAST-15).

6. **Audit dependencies** (F-SAST-13/16):
   - Run the package manager's audit if available (npm audit, pip audit, cargo audit, etc.).
   - Check for known CVEs.

7. **Classify the findings** and apply the catalog's disposition:
   - 🔴 **Critical** and 🟠 **High** → FAIL, always blocking, **not suppressible**.
   - 🟡 **Medium** → FAIL by default, suppressible only with the full documentation in §4.4.
   - 🟢 **Low / Informational** → WARNING, reported, does not block.

## Suppressions

**Every finding, including false positives, has to be documented** — an undocumented finding is an
unreviewed finding. To suppress a Medium, use the 7-field format in
`.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §4.4 (file, category, disposition, reviewer, date,
justification, compensating control/review-by). Missing any field is a FAIL (F-SAST-18), and a
suppression older than 6 months has to be re-evaluated (F-SAST-19).

Critical and High can never be suppressed. They get fixed.

**Write the report to `docs/daw/security/sast-{ticket}.md`, then validate it:**

`python3 .daw/scripts/validate_sast.py docs/daw/security/sast-{ticket}.md --tier <tier>`

(under a plugin install, resolve `.daw/scripts/` at the plugin's method path). **Paste its output
VERBATIM** — every row, every rule ID, on **every** run, including a re-validation of a report that
has not changed. A PASSED run writes the content-hashed receipt the `sast` gate demands; without it
the transition out of CODE refuses — CODE→VERIFY, or CODE→CLOSEOUT in QUICK-FIX.

**What that receipt does and does not say.** DAW does not scan your code — the scan above is a model
reading it, and no file can make that a proof. What the validator answers is whether the **report**
is complete: every catalogued category carrying a verdict, every finding naming a file and a line,
the stated result consistent with the severities listed, every Medium fixed or suppressed, every
suppression carrying its fields and still inside its review window. The judgement stays yours to
read; what stops being optional is the shape of the record. The script says exactly this on every
run, because a receipt whose scope is unstated gets read as covering everything.

The four steps in the catalog's *How a validation runs* apply here: run the script, loop on every ❌
(fixing only what the rule names), ask about what genuinely needs a human decision, then show the
whole table plus the link to the report on disk and ask for approval.

**The report has to be parseable, which means the rule IDs travel with their verdicts.** One line per
catalogued category, its ID and its ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ on that same line, and a `file:line` on anything
found. A prose paragraph that says the same thing is a report nothing can check — which is how
nineteen catalogued rules went years without one of them being executed.

### The report, in the shape the validator reads

The console box above is what the USER sees. This is the file, and it is the only shape
`validate_sast.py` can read: **every catalogued category on its own line, its ID and its verdict on
that line**, because a paragraph saying the same thing is a report nothing can check. Written the
way the box groups things — four rubrics, prose underneath — the validator answers
`❌ F-SAST-COVERAGE: 11 categor(y/ies) with no verdict`, which reads to the user as "your scan is
incomplete" about a scan that was not.

# SAST {ticket}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Ticket | {ticket} |
| Tools | semgrep 1.86, npm audit |
| Date | 2026-08-06 |

| Rule | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| F-SAST-01 | ✅ | no embedded secrets; the key comes from `.env`, which is gitignored |
| F-SAST-02 | ✅ | every query is parameterised |
| F-SAST-03 | ✅ | nothing reaches exec/spawn |
| F-SAST-04 | ✅ | no eval, no unsafe deserialisation |
| F-SAST-05 | ✅ | no user input in file paths |
| F-SAST-06 | ✅ | output escaped by the template engine |
| F-SAST-07 | ✅ | no outbound fetch driven by user input |
| F-SAST-08 | ✅ | bcrypt cost 12; no MD5/SHA1 for passwords |
| F-SAST-09 | ✅ | debug is off in the production config |
| F-SAST-10 | ✅ | nothing sensitive is logged |
| F-SAST-11 | ✅ | there is no upload surface |
| F-SAST-12 | ✅ | CSRF tokens on every state-changing form |
| F-SAST-13 | ✅ | npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities |
| F-SAST-14 | ✅ | input validated at the boundary |
| F-SAST-15 | ✅ | errors return an id, not a stack |
| F-SAST-16 | ✅ | no known CVEs in the new packages |
| F-SAST-17 | ✅ | no dynamic code paths |

## Suppressions
None.

Total: 17 clean, 0 vulnerabilities (0 critical, 0 high)
Result: PASSED
```

A finding replaces its `✅` with `❌` and names the file and line in the Notes column — `app/config.py:9`
— and the totals and the Result line have to agree with it: a Critical above a `PASSED` is refused by
`F-SAST-VERDICT`, and a Critical filed under `⚠️` by `F-SAST-SEVERITY`. A Medium that is neither
fixed nor suppressed with its seven fields is refused by `F-SAST-MEDIUM` and `F-SAST-18`.

## PASS/FAIL criteria
- **PASSED:** 0 Critical or High vulnerabilities, and every Medium either fixed or properly
  suppressed → `gates.sast` = `true`.
- **BLOCKED:** 1+ Critical or High → fix before advancing. Max 3 attempts, then escalate to the
  user.

For triage of whether a finding is a true or false positive, spawn `daw-sec-auditor` via the Agent
tool.

## Tier modifier: QUICK-FIX
SAST **applies in full**. It is that tier's only security validation and it is not relaxed.

## Updating .daw-state.json
- `gates.sast` → `true` on PASS. The report is saved to `docs/daw/security/sast-{ticket}.md` (derived
  from the ticket).

## Language

Write the report in the language the user is working in, citing the rule IDs verbatim.
