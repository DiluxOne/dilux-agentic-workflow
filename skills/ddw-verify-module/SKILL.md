# Skill: /ddw-verify-module

## Description
Verifies that a completed module meets every acceptance criterion in its PRD and every task in its
spec. A blocking gate.

## Inputs
- The PRD at `docs/ddw/prd/prd-{ticket}.md` (if `gates.define` is true and the tier is FEATURE).
- The spec/fix-plan at `docs/ddw/specs/spec-{ticket}.md` or `docs/ddw/specs/fix-{ticket}.md` (if
  `gates.spec` is true).
- The implemented code.
- The tests, and their results.
- `.ddw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §5 for the rules (F-VER-01 to F-VER-06, W-VER-01 to
  W-VER-03) — the single source of truth.
- The `tier` from `.ddw-state.json`.

## Execution Protocol

### For FEATURE

1. **Verify the PRD's acceptance criteria** (F-VER-01):
   For EVERY acceptance criterion:
   - Does the code implement it? (exact location: file:function)
   - Is there a test verifying it — and is that test passing?
   - Does the test verify the actual behavior, or only the status code? Status-code-only is a
     WARNING, not a PASS.

2. **Verify the spec's tasks** (F-VER-02, F-VER-06):
   For EVERY checkbox in the spec:
   - Is it marked complete?
   - Does the corresponding code exist?
   - Does every test the spec listed exist and pass? Those are approved commitments.

3. **Verify coverage** (F-VER-03):
   - Lines ≥ 80%, branches ≥ 80%, functions ≥ 80% over the new/modified code. Below any of them is a
     FAIL, not a warning.
   - Core business logic between 80–90% is a WARNING (W-VER-02): it should be higher.

4. **Verify sad paths** (F-VER-04):
   - Every endpoint or function accepting input needs at least one test with invalid input.
     Happy-path-only is a FAIL.

5. **Verify quality:**
   - Lint/type checker passes with no errors (F-VER-05).
   - No dead code or unused imports (W-VER-01).
   - No fragile tests: order dependencies, global state, hardcoded timestamps/IDs (W-VER-03).

### For FIX

1. **Verify the fix-plan's solution:**
   - Were all the steps implemented (F-VER-02)?
   - Does the regression test exist, reproduce the original bug, and pass with the fix applied?

2. **Verify no regressions were introduced:**
   - The full test suite passes.
   - Lint passes (F-VER-05).

### Then, for every tier: write the verdict and validate that it is complete

Write the verdict to `docs/ddw/reports/verify-{ticket}.md` — every AC by ID with its result, every
FEATURE block or FIX step, every promised test, the three coverage numbers, the sad-path answer and
the lint answer. Then run:

`python3 .ddw/scripts/validate_verify.py docs/ddw/reports/verify-{ticket}.md --tier <tier>`

(under a plugin install, resolve `.ddw/scripts/` at the plugin's method path). **Paste its output
VERBATIM** — every row, every rule ID, on **every** run, including a re-validation of a verdict that
has not changed. A PASSED run writes the content-hashed receipt the `verify` gate demands; without it
the VERIFY→CLOSEOUT transition refuses.

**What that receipt does and does not say.** DDW does not run your suite — it does not know your
runner, your directory or your environment, and a gate that cannot be satisfied honestly gets
satisfied dishonestly (`docs/RATIONALE.md` decisions 2 and 16). The script checks that the verdict is
**complete**: that no acceptance criterion is missing from it, no block or fix-plan step is unaccounted for, the three
coverage numbers are stated and clear the minimum, and lint and the sad paths have an answer instead
of a silence. The numbers themselves remain your report of what you ran. Say that plainly to the
user rather than letting the receipt imply more.

**Every ❌ from the script is a mandatory loop** — but the loop is on the *report*, not the code:
verification never patches code (see PASS/FAIL criteria below). A missing row gets written; a real
failure sends the ticket back to CODE.

## Verification levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ✅ **PASS** | The code implements the criterion AND a test verifies the behavior |
| ⚠️ **WARN** | Code is fine but the test is superficial (status code only), or a non-critical item is missing |
| ❌ **FAIL** | Missing code, missing test, or a failing test |

```

Both rows are mandatory: the first is the verdict, the second is the validator's checklist — the
path the script printed, so the user can read every rule instead of asking for it again.

### The verdict document, in the shape the validator reads

The box above is what the USER sees. `docs/ddw/reports/verify-{ticket}.md` is what the validator
reads, and it had no canonical shape at all — so a complete verdict could be refused for its layout:
an AC named without its identifier, a block referred to by name only, `sad-path` written with the
hyphen English actually uses. Write it like this:

```markdown
# Verification {ticket}

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Module | app/routes/public.py |
| Line coverage | 91% |
| Branch coverage | 84% |
| Function coverage | 88% |
| Coverage floor | 80% (AGENTS.md, "Testing") |
| Lint | `ruff check .` — clean |

## Acceptance criteria
- ✅ AC-01 — `test_form_visible` (app/routes/public.py:12)
- ✅ AC-02 — `test_campo_faltante_devuelve_400`
- ✅ AC-03 — `test_email_invalido_devuelve_422`

## Spec blocks
- ✅ Block 1 — every task done, tests named above

## Tests
- ✅ Sad-path tests: `test_email_invalido_devuelve_422` covers the documented 422 path

Result: PASSED
```

Every AC by its **identifier** (`AC-01`, not "the first criterion"), every block by its **number**,
every test the spec promised by **name**, the three coverage numbers, and the floor quoted from the
project. Those are what F-VER-01 to F-VER-06 look for, one rule each.

For FIX, use `- ✅ Paso 1 — ...` for **each** numbered `## Solution — steps` item. Under
`## Tests`, report **each** promised bullet as `- ✅ Prueba 1 — <first line of the bullet without
Markdown formatting> — <actual run/result>`, in the same order. Use ❌ when evidence fails or is
missing; do not mark a test green just to satisfy the parser. The first-line description ties the
verdict to the approved fix-plan, which often names commands and behaviors rather than `test_*`
functions. A mere file path or an unnumbered summary does not cover a promised test. The independent
reviewer must inspect the underlying execution evidence, not just the checkmarks in this report.

## PASS/FAIL criteria
- **PASSED:** 0 FAILs → `gates.verify` = `true`. WARNINGs are reported and do not block.
- **BLOCKED:** 1+ FAILs → go back to the CODE phase to fix. Never patch the code in VERIFY. Max 3
  attempts, then escalate to the user.

For detailed cross-verification, spawn `ddw-module-verifier` via the Agent tool — an agent that did
not write the code.

## Tier modifier: QUICK-FIX
Does not apply — that tier has no VERIFY phase.

## Updating .ddw-state.json
- `gates.verify` → `true` on PASS. The report is saved to `docs/ddw/reports/verify-{ticket}.md`
  (derived path), including the WARNINGs that did not block. A BLOCKED run is written too — the
  round that failed is what explains the corrective loop that follows it.

## Language

Write the report in the language the user is working in, citing the rule IDs verbatim.
