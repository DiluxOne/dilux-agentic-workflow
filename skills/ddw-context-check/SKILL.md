# Skill: /ddw-context-check

## Description

DDW runs commands: the test suite, the linter, the type checker. It learns them from the context
file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) — and when that file does not mention one, DDW does not
run it. The result is code that passes every gate and then fails your CI, or commits that your
`pre-commit` hook rejects for reasons the agent has no way to explain.

This skill compares the two: **what the repo already says about how it is built**, against **what
the context file told DDW**. It reports the difference and proposes a one-line fix for each.

It is **read-only until you say otherwise**, it **never blocks**, and it writes to exactly one file
— the context file — and only with your approval.

## What it must NOT report

This restriction is the skill, not a caveat on it.

**It reports only knowledge the agent cannot discover on its own** — the commands DDW is about to
run. It never proposes prose, conventions, architecture, style guidance, or anything the agent can
find by reading a file at the moment it needs it.

The reason is evidence, not taste. A study across 138 real repositories found that repository
context files produced **no improvement in agent task success rate while adding over 20% to
inference cost**, with LLM-generated ones actively hurting; the authors' conclusion was that these
files should be minimal rather than comprehensive. A skill that grows the context file is therefore
not a neutral act — without this restriction, this one becomes the problem that study describes.

> Recorded, with its sources, as decision 8 in `docs/RATIONALE.md`.

## Inputs

- The context file in use (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md`) — its "Stack" and commands.
- `AGENTS.md`, when present — the optional `## Specification framework` setting is read from this
  file only.
- The repository root and its configuration files (read-only).

## Execution Protocol

1. Read the context file. Note every command it declares and every `ddw:declined` marker.
2. Look for each piece of evidence below. **Evidence means a file that exists** — never an
   assumption about what this project ought to use.
3. Report only the gaps, and only ones not already declined for this ticket.

| Evidence in the repo | Gap, if the context file does not declare it | Why it costs something |
|---|---|---|
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | no pre-commit step | Your hook rejects the agent's commits and it cannot say why |
| A CI workflow (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, …) | a command CI runs that DDW does not | CI is the repo's real contract. Anything it runs that DDW does not, the PR discovers |
| Linter config (`[tool.ruff]`, `.eslintrc*`, `.golangci.yml`, …) | no lint command | Code that passes the gates and fails style |
| Type checker (`[tool.mypy]`, `tsconfig.json` with `strict`, …) | no typecheck command | Type errors no test catches |
| Test runner config / a `tests/` directory | no test command, or a different one | `ddw-test` runs the wrong thing, or nothing |
| A coverage threshold configured in the repo | it differs from the 80% in `.ddw/rules/testing.instructions.md` | Two thresholds, and the stricter one is a surprise |
| `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `.tool-versions` | no runtime version | Runs against the wrong version |
| A lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, …) | no install command | The agent guesses the package manager |

### Optional OpenSpec framework check

This is not a required context heading. **Do not report an absent `## Specification framework`
section, or its default `Spec format: DAW`, as a gap.** DAW's legacy format is the default and must
remain silent.

If `AGENTS.md` has that heading and attempts to select OpenSpec, the only active opt-in is these
exact lines:

```markdown
## Specification framework
Spec format: OpenSpec
```

For that active opt-in, check two discoverable prerequisites:

| Evidence | Finding when missing | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `openspec` is executable on `PATH` | OpenSpec CLI is unavailable | PLAN cannot run `openspec validate <slug> --strict` |
| `openspec/specs/` exists | OpenSpec product baseline is unavailable | PLAN has no baseline against which to prepare a proposed change |

If the section mentions OpenSpec but does not use the exact marker, report the marker as malformed
and show the exact two lines above. **Do not describe the repository as OpenSpec-enabled, or claim
that DAW will validate an OpenSpec change, until both the exact marker and prerequisites are present.**
These are findings for an explicitly requested mode, not a prompt to opt every project in.

## Also: the sections the method reads

The context file is not only commands. The method reads it by **heading**, and a heading that is not
there is a lookup that silently finds nothing:

| Heading | Read by |
|---|---|
| `## Stack` | CLASSIFY, CODE, `ddw-test`, `ddw-security-sast`, `ddw-threat-modeling`, `ddw-create-prd`, `ddw-create-adr`, `ddw-help`, `ddw-sec-auditor` |
| `## Architecture conventions` | PLAN, CODE, `ddw-validate-arch`, `ddw-arch-auditor` |
| `## Code conventions` | `ddw-arch-auditor` |
| `## What NOT to do in this project` | `ddw-arch-auditor` |
| `## Domain glossary` | DEFINE, PLAN |
| `## Testing` | `ddw-test`, `ddw-verify-module` — the coverage floor and where it came from |
| `## What this project is` | CLASSIFY, `ddw-create-prd` — what the work is FOR, when the request does not say |
| `## Repo family` | CLASSIFY Step 1.2 — the mono/multi switch; only report it as missing when the repo visibly belongs to a family (a workspace repo names it), never as a default gap |
| `## Specification framework` | PLAN and `ddw-validate-spec` — optional OpenSpec opt-in; absence/default DAW is not a gap |

`AGENTS.md` is copied from DDW's template **once**, when the installer finds none. Three situations
leave it without these, and all three are ordinary:

- **The repo already had its own `AGENTS.md`.** The template is never applied — correctly, it is
  their file — so none of these headings exist and nobody was told.
- **A later version of DDW added one.** The template grew; the installed file did not, because
  nothing outside the `BEGIN DDW` block is managed.
- **There is no `AGENTS.md` at all**, which is the ordinary state of a **plugin** install: the
  installer never ran, so nothing was copied. Report the FILE, not each heading in turn — a list of
  six missing headings for a file that does not exist reads as six problems instead of one — and
  point at CLASSIFY Step 1, which offers to create it with the project's own content. Never write
  DDW's own material into it: under a plugin the repo is meant to come away with nothing of DDW's
  in it.

So report a missing required heading like any other gap, with **the heading and one line saying what
reads it**. Do not apply this rule to the optional `## Specification framework` heading. Propose the
required heading, empty, and nothing else: what goes underneath is the user's to write, and writing
it for them is the bloat this skill exists to avoid. For `## Stack` specifically, CLASSIFY
already knows how to detect a stack from the repo's config files and offer the text — point at that
rather than duplicating it.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every finding carries **the evidence with its `file:line`, and the exact line to add**. A finding
the user has to go and investigate is a finding they will skip.

**If there are no gaps, say so in one line and stop.** A panel that appears every ticket with
nothing in it is how people learn not to read the panel.

## Updating the context file

Only after approval, and only the context file:

- **Accepted** → the declared command is added to its Stack section. Nothing else is written: no
  prose, no explanation, no heading the file did not already have.
- **Declined** → a marker is written so the full panel does not interrogate you again:

  ```
  <!-- ddw:declined FEAT-001 lint typecheck -->
  ```

**A decline is per ticket, not forever.** The next session mentions it in one line —
*"2 recommendations declined — `/ddw-context-check` to see them"* — and nothing more. A "never
again" that silently disappears is worse than a question: the day the gap actually costs you
something, nothing will be there to say it was known. And re-asking in full every session is how a
useful check gets turned off.

Never write to `pyproject.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, CI workflows or any other configuration.
This skill teaches DDW what your repo already says; it does not change what your repo says.

## The record the classify edge reads

Whatever the outcome — gaps found, gaps declined, nothing to report — land it in
`.ddw-work/context-check-<ticket>.md` (one file per ticket; `context-check.md` when the work has
no ticket yet). The findings as shown, or the single line
`Nothing to report: the context file matches the repo.` The edge out of CLASSIFY refuses to open
without this file, because on two measured general runs this skill was simply never invoked and
nothing anywhere could tell. The file is the proof the step happened; the panel above stays the
proof of what it said.

## PASS/FAIL criteria

- N/A. This skill has findings, not a verdict. **It never sets a gate and never blocks a
  transition.** DDW cannot know that your project ought to run a linter — only that it has one
  configured and DDW was not told. Reporting a fact is useful; blocking on an inference is not.

## Updating .ddw-state.json

- NONE.

## Language

Write the findings in the language the user is working in. Keep commands, file paths and the
`ddw:declined` marker verbatim.
