  The impact analysis a family repo owes before leaving CLASSIFY: gathers the whole family fresh

# Skill: /daw-family-impact

## Description

Standing in ANY repo of a family, classification's first duty is the impact question: which
members does this work hit, and which does it provably not. This skill is that step. Its
deterministic half is `family_impact.py`; the judgment half is yours.

A repo with no `## Repo family` section never needs this: single-repo flow, untouched.

## Protocol

1. **Gather the facts** (script, not memory):

   ```bash
   python3 .daw/scripts/family_impact.py --ticket <TICKET>
   ```

   It resolves the family from this repo's `## Repo family` and **reads the workspace and
   every member at their default branch from the forge — cloning nothing**: the map
   (`daw-family.md`) and every member's seams, freshness by construction, each repo recorded at
   the SHA it was read and with HOW it was read (`forge`, or a sibling clone that already
   existed and was fetched — the offline fallback). The facts land in
   `.daw-work/impact-data-<TICKET>.json`. **When the workspace carries a derived store**
   (`docs/daw/store/renglones.md`), each member arrives with its renglón and the commit that
   row was written at — a row behind the repo is reported, not hidden, and never blocks: the
   analysis happens over facts that say how old they are. The standing repo itself is fetched, and
   fast-forwarded only when clean and on the default branch — a diverged tree is reported,
   never merged over.

2. **Write the verdict** to `.daw-work/impact-<TICKET>.md`. For EVERY member the gather
   printed: impacted (with what part of the work hits it), or `Sin impacto: <reason>` — and the
   reason names the contract that stays intact, not a shrug. Walk `Consumed by` of everything
   the work touches: a consumer of a changing seam that is missing from the impacted list is
   the analysis failing at its one job.

3. **Validate it**:

   ```bash
   python3 .daw/scripts/family_impact.py --validate .daw-work/impact-<TICKET>.md
   ```

   Every member accounted for, no invented repos, reasons that exist. On PASS it writes the
   content-hashed receipt (`.daw-sessions/impact-validated-…`) that the CLASSIFY→DEFINE gate
   demands. Editing the verdict afterwards kills the receipt — revalidate.

4. **Classify with the verdict in hand**: one impacted repo (this one) → an ordinary local
   ticket, normal pipeline. Multiple impacted repos → a multirepo initiative: the index in the
   workspace, per `define.instructions.md` § Multirepo split.

## The honest bargain

The receipt does not prove the judgment is right. It proves the judgment was made over the
WHOLE family, freshly read — and that skipping the step is a deliberate act that leaves no
file where the record demands one.
