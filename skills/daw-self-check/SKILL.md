# Skill: /daw-self-check

## Description

Full coherence validation of the internal state. Checks that DAW's installation in the repo is
sound, and that the pipeline state matches the artifacts on disk. It is read-only — it modifies no
file.

## Inputs

- `.daw/orchestrator.md` (the method installed into the repo)
- The context file for the tool in use (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md`), carrying the
  `BEGIN DAW` block
- That tool's hook wiring (`.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json`,
  `.gemini/settings.json`, `.github/hooks/`, `.opencode/plugins/`)
- `.daw-state.json` (the pipeline state, at the repo root)
- The artifacts derived from the ticket (PRD, spec, branch)

## Execution Protocol

### 0. Validate DAW's installation in the repo

```bash
ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"

# The method must be present.
[ -f "$ROOT/.daw/orchestrator.md" ] || \
  echo "INCONSISTENCY: .daw/orchestrator.md is missing. Reinstall with install.sh."

# Some context file must carry the activation block. Which one depends on the
# tool, and a repo may legitimately have several — so each is asked separately.
# Handing grep three filenames when only one exists exits 2 for the missing
# operand EVEN AFTER a match, so this reported a healthy install as broken on
# every one of the six tools.
found=0
for f in CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md GEMINI.md; do
  [ -f "$ROOT/$f" ] && grep -qF "BEGIN DAW" "$ROOT/$f" && found=1
done
[ "$found" = 1 ] || \
  echo "INCONSISTENCY: no context file carries the DAW block. Reinstall with install.sh."

# At least one tool's enforcement must be wired, or the gates are decoration.
# Same shape, same reason: one `ls` over six globs fails when any of them matches
# nothing, and five of the six never match in a single-tool install.
wired=0
for g in "$ROOT"/.claude/hooks/*.sh "$ROOT"/.codex/hooks/daw/*.sh "$ROOT"/.cursor/hooks/daw/*.sh \
         "$ROOT"/.gemini/hooks/daw/*.sh "$ROOT"/.github/hooks/daw/*.sh \
         "$ROOT"/.opencode/plugins/daw.js; do
  [ -e "$g" ] && wired=1
done
[ "$wired" = 1 ] || \
  echo "INCONSISTENCY: no enforcement is wired for any tool. Reinstall with install.sh --target <tool>."
```

### 1. Validate the `.daw-state.json` schema

- The file exists (if it does not, ASSUMING IDLE is valid — it is created on the first write by the
  `enforce.sh` hook).
- If it exists, the **10** mandatory fields are present: `tier`, `phase`, `ticket`, `title`,
  `tracker`, `autonomy`, `gates`, `block`, `discovery`, `history`. `autonomy` absent or `null` reads
  as `assisted` and is NOT an inconsistency — a state written before the field existed did not opt
  into anything, and reporting it as broken would fail every repo that upgraded.
- `phase` is a valid value (`IDLE`, `CLASSIFY`, `DEFINE`, `PLAN`, `CODE`, `VERIFY`, `CLOSEOUT`,
  `DISCOVERY`).
- `tier` is `null` (in IDLE/CLASSIFY) or a valid value (`QUICK-FIX`, `FIX`, `FEATURE`,
  `DISCOVERY`).
- If `phase` is neither IDLE nor CLASSIFY, `tier` should not be `null`.
- `gates` is an object and `history` is a list.

### 2. Validate the state against what is on disk

A state that claims a gate no artifact backs is the failure this skill exists to catch.

- The branch derived from `ticket` and `tier` is the one checked out (`git branch --show-current`).
- `gates.define` → `docs/daw/prd/prd-{ticket}.md` exists (or `fix-{ticket}.md` for QUICK-FIX).
- `gates.spec` → `docs/daw/specs/spec-{ticket}.md` or `fix-{ticket}.md` exists.
- `gates.threat` → `docs/daw/security/threat-{ticket}.md` exists.
- `gates.sast` → `docs/daw/security/sast-{ticket}.md` exists.
- On a FIX: `docs/daw/specs/rca-{ticket}.md` exists once DEFINE has closed.

### 3. Validate the history

- `history` is non-empty whenever `phase` is not IDLE.
- Its last entry's `to` equals `phase`.
- Every entry has `timestamp`, `from`, `to` and `action`, and the timestamps do not go backwards.
- Each entry's `from` matches the previous entry's `to` (no gaps).

```

## PASS/FAIL criteria

- **SOUND:** zero inconsistencies.
- **INCONSISTENCIES (N):** report every one of them, with the fix, and STOP.

## Updating `.daw-state.json`

**None. This skill is strictly read-only.** It never repairs what it finds — a state machine that
quietly fixes its own state is a state machine you cannot trust the next time it says it is fine.
